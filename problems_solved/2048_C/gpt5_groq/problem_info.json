  "statement": "Kevin discovered a binary string s that starts with 1 in the river at Moonlit River Park and handed it over to you. Your task is to select two non-empty substrings^{\\text{\u2217}} of s (which can be overlapped) to maximize the XOR value of these two substrings.The XOR of two binary strings a and b is defined as the result of the \\oplus operation applied to the two numbers obtained by interpreting a and b as binary numbers, with the leftmost bit representing the highest value. Here, \\oplus denotes the",

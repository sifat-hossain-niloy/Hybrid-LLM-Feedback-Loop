  "statement": "Cirno has a sequence a of length n. She can perform either of the following two operations for any (possibly, zero) times unless the current length of a is 1: Reverse the sequence. Formally, [a_1,a_2,...,a_n] becomes [a_n,a_{n-1},...,a_1] after the operation. Replace the sequence with its difference sequence. Formally, [a_1,a_2,...,a_n] becomes [a_2-a_1,a_3-a_2,...,a_n-a_{n-1}] after the operation. Find the maximum possible sum of elements of a after all operations.",

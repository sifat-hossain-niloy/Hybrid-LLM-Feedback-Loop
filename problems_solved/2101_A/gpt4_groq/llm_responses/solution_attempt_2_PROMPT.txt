**Problem: 2101_A**

You are given n^2 cards with values from 0 to n^2-1. You are to arrange them in a n by n grid such that there is exactly one card in each cell.The MEX (minimum excluded value) of a subgrid^{\text{∗}} is defined as the smallest non-negative integer that does not appear in the subgrid.Your task is to arrange the cards such that the sum of MEX values over all ≤ft(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\right)^2 subgrids is maximized.^{\text{∗}}A subgrid of a n by n grid is specified by four numbers l_1, r_1, l_2, r_2 satisfying 1≤ l_1≤ r_1≤ n and 1≤ l_2≤ r_2≤ n. The element in the i-th row and the j-th column of the grid is part of the subgrid if and only if l_1≤ i≤ r_1 and l_2≤ j≤ r_2.

  "statement": "You are given n^2 cards with values from 0 to n^2-1. You are to arrange them in a n by n grid such that there is exactly one card in each cell.The MEX (minimum excluded value) of a subgrid^{\\text{\u2217}} is defined as the smallest non-negative integer that does not appear in the subgrid.Your task is to arrange the cards such that the sum of MEX values over all \u2264ft(\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\\right)^2 subgrids is maximized.^{\\text{\u2217}}A subgrid of a n by n grid is specified by four numbers l_1, r_1, l_2, r_2 sat",

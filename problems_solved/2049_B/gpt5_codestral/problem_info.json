(dot), determine whether a permutation^{\\text{\u2217}} p of length n exists, such that for all integers i (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n): If s_i is p, then [p_1, p_2, ..., p_i] forms a permutation (of length i); If s_i is s, then [p_i, p_{i+1}, ..., p_{n}] forms a permutation (of length n-i+1); If s_i is .",

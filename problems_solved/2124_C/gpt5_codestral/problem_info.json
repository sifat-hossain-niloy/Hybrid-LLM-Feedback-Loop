  "statement": "Alice has an array a, consisting of n positive integers. The array satisfies the beautiful property that a_i divides a_{i+1} for each 1 \u2264q i \u2264q n - 1. Bob sees Alice's beautiful array and is jealous. To sabotage her, Bob first creates an array b of size n such that b_i=a_i for each 1 \u2264q i \u2264q n. Then, he chooses a positive integer x and multiplies some (possibly none, possibly all) elements in b by x. Formally, he chooses a (possibly-empty) subset S\u2282eq\\{1,2,...,n\\}, and for each i\u2208 S, he sets b_i",

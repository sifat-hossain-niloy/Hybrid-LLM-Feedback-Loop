The Krug's goal is not to be caught by Doran for as long as possible, while Doran's goal is to catch the Krug as early as possible. We say Doran caught the Krug if they stand on the same grid cell.To play the game, the Krug and Doran take turns alternately, starting from the Krug: The Krug can either stay in the same cell or move to a cell vertical",

**Problem: 2039_D**

Shohag has an integer n and a set S of m unique integers. Help him find the lexicographically largest^{\text{∗}} integer array a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that a_i ∈ S for each 1 ≤ i ≤ n and a_{\operatorname{gcd}(i, j)} ≠q \operatorname{gcd}(a_i, a_j)^{\text{†}} is satisfied over all pairs 1 ≤ i \lt j ≤ n, or state that no such array exists.^{\text{∗}}An array a is lexicographically larger than an array b of the same length if a ≠ b, and in the first position where a and b differ, the array a has a larger element than the corresponding element in b.^{\text{†}}\gcd(x, y) denotes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of integers x and y.

**Task:** Please provide a well-structured and optimized C++ solution.

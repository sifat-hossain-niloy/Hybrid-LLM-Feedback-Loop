**Problem: 2134_C**

An array is called good if, for every subarray^{\text{∗}} of length at least 2, the sum of the elements at even indices (with respect to the original array) is greater than or equal to the sum of the elements at odd indices. Array indexing starts from 1.For example, the arrays [3,8,4,4] and [2,3,1,4,2] are good. The array [0,2,4,1] is not because, in the subarray [2,4,1], the elements at even indices in the original array are 2 (index 2) and 1 (index 4), while the only element at an odd index is 4 (index 3). Since 2 + 1 < 4, the condition does not hold for this subarray.You are given an array of n non-negative integers a_1,a_2,...,a_n. In one operation, you can decrease any element in the array by 1, but all elements must remain non-negative. Your task is to find the minimum number of operations needed to make the array a good. It can be proved that it is possible to make the array good using a finite number of operations.^{\text{∗}}An array b is a subarray of an array a if b can be ob

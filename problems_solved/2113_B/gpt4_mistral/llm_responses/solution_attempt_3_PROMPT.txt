**Problem: 2113_B**

The roof is a rectangle of size w × h with the bottom left corner at the point (0, 0) on the plane. Your team needs to completely cover this roof with identical roofing sheets of size a × b, with the following conditions: The sheets cannot be rotated (not even by 90^\circ). The sheets must not overlap (but they can touch at the edges). The sheets can extend beyond the boundaries of the rectangular roof. A novice from your team has already placed two such sheets on the roof in such a way that the sheets do not overlap and each of them partially covers the roof.Your task is to determine whether it is possible to completely tile the roof without removing either of the two already placed sheets.

  "statement": "You have an array a of length n consisting of non-zero integers. Initially, you have 0 coins, and you will do the following until a is empty: Let m be the current size of a. Select an integer i where 1 \u2264 i \u2264 m, gain |a_i|^{\\text{\u2217}} coins, and then: if a_i < 0, then replace a with [a_1,a_2,...,a_{i - 1}] (that is, delete the suffix beginning with a_i); otherwise, replace a with [a_{i + 1},a_{i + 2},...,a_m] (that is, delete the prefix ending with a_i). Find the maximum number of coins you can ha",

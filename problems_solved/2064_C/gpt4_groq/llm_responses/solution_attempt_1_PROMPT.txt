You are a competitive programming expert.

**Problem: 2064_C**

You have an array a of length n consisting of non-zero integers. Initially, you have 0 coins, and you will do the following until a is empty: Let m be the current size of a. Select an integer i where 1 ≤ i ≤ m, gain |a_i|^{\text{∗}} coins, and then: if a_i < 0, then replace a with [a_1,a_2,...,a_{i - 1}] (that is, delete the suffix beginning with a_i); otherwise, replace a with [a_{i + 1},a_{i + 2},...,a_m] (that is, delete the prefix ending with a_i). Find the maximum number of coins you can have at the end of the process.^{\text{∗}}Here |a_i| represents the absolute value of a_i: it equals a_i when a_i > 0 and -a_i when a_i < 0.

**Task:** Please provide a well-structured and optimized C++ solution.

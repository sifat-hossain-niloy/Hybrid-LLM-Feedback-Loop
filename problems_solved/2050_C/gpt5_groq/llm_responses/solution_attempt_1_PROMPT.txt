**Problem: 2050_C**

You are given a number n with a length of no more than 10^5.You can perform the following operation any number of times: choose one of its digits, square it, and replace the original digit with the result. The result must be a digit (that is, if you choose the digit x, then the value of x^2 must be less than 10).Is it possible to obtain a number that is divisible by 9 through these operations?

**Task:** Please provide a well-structured and optimized C++ solution.

  "statement": "This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference is the constraint on k and the total sum of n and q across all test cases. You can make hacks only if both versions of the problem are solved.You are given a strip of length 10^{15} and a constant k. There are exactly n cells that contain a traffic light; each has a position p_i and an initial delay d_i for which d_i < k. The i-th traffic light works the following way: it shows red at the l \u00b7 k + d_i-th second, where l is an integer, i",

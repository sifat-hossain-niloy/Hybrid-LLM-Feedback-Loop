  "statement": "For an integer sequence a = [a_1, a_2, ..., a_n], we define f(a) as the length of the longest subsequence^{\\text{\u2217}} of a that is a palindrome^{\\text{\u2020}}. Let g(a) represent the number of subsequences of length f(a) that are palindromes. In other words, g(a) counts the number of palindromic subsequences in a that have the maximum length.Given an integer n, your task is to find any sequence a of n integers that satisfies the following conditions: 1 \u2264 a_i \u2264 n for all 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n. g(a) > n It can be ",

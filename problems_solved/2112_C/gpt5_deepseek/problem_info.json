Then Bob chooses any element and colors it blue (if it was red\u00a0\u2014 recolor it). Alice wins if the sum of the red elements is strictly greater than the value of the blue element.Your task is to calculate the number of ways that Alice can choose 3 elements in order to win regardless of Bob's actions.",

  "statement": "A circular array b of length m is nice if every element has at least one adjacent element^{\\text{\u2217}} that is equal to it. Formally, for every 1\u2264 i\u2264 m, at least one of the following holds: b_i = b_{(i+m-2)\\bmod m\\;+1}, or b_i = b_{i\\bmod m\\;+1}, where x \\bmod y denotes the remainder from dividing x by y. You are given a circular array a of length n. In one operation, you may increase or decrease any element of a by 1. Your task is to determine the minimum number of operations required to make arr",

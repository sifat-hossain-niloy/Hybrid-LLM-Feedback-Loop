You are a competitive programming expert.

**Problem: 2084_C**

You are given a permutation a and b of length n^{\text{∗}}. You can perform the following operation at most n times: Choose two indices i and j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n, i ≠ j), swap a_i with a_j, swap b_i with b_j. Determine whether a and b can be reverses of each other after operations. In other words, for each i = 1, 2, ..., n, a_i = b_{n + 1 - i}.If it is possible, output any valid sequence of operations. Otherwise, output -1.^{\text{∗}}A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

  "statement": "You are given a permutation a and b of length n^{\\text{\u2217}}. You can perform the following operation at most n times: Choose two indices i and j (1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 n, i \u2260 j), swap a_i with a_j, swap b_i with b_j. Determine whether a and b can be reverses of each other after operations. In other words, for each i = 1, 2, ..., n, a_i = b_{n + 1 - i}.If it is possible, output any valid sequence of operations. Otherwise, output -1.^{\\text{\u2217}}A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct int",

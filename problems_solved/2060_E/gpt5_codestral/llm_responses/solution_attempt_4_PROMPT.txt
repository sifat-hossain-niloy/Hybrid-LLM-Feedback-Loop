You are a competitive programming expert.

**Problem: 2060_E**

You are given two simple undirected graphs F and G with n vertices. F has m_1 edges while G has m_2 edges. You may perform one of the following two types of operations any number of times: Select two integers u and v (1 ≤q u,v ≤q n) such that there is an edge between u and v in F. Then, remove that edge from F. Select two integers u and v (1 ≤q u,v ≤q n) such that there is no edge between u and v in F. Then, add an edge between u and v in F. Determine the minimum number of operations required such that for all integers u and v (1 ≤q u,v ≤q n), there is a path from u to v in F if and only if there is a path from u to v in G.

**Problem: 2065_E**

With the approach of Valentine's Day, Skibidus desperately needs a way to rizz up his crush! Fortunately, he knows of just the way: creating the perfect Binary String!Given a binary string^{\text{∗}} t, let x represent the number of \texttt{0} in t and y represent the number of \texttt{1} in t. Its balance-value is defined as the value of \max(x-y, y-x).Skibidus gives you three integers n, m, and k. He asks for your help to construct a binary string s of length n+m with exactly n \texttt{0}'s and m \texttt{1}'s such that the maximum balance-value among all of its substrings^{\text{†}} is exactly k. If it is not possible, output -1.^{\text{∗}}A binary string only consists of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1}.^{\text{†}}A string a is a substring of a string b if a can be obtained from b by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the end.

**Task:** Please provide a well-structured and optimized C++ solution.

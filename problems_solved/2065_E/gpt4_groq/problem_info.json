Fortunately, he knows of just the way: creating the perfect Binary String!Given a binary string^{\\text{\u2217}} t, let x represent the number of \\texttt{0} in t and y represent the number of \\texttt{1} in t. Its balance-value is defined as the value of \\max(x-y, y-x).Skibidus gives you three integers n, m, and k. He asks for your help to construct a binary string s of length n+m with exactly n \\texttt{0}'s an",

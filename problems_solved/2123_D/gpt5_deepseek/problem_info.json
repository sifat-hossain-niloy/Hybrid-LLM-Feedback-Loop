  "statement": "Alice and Bob are given a binary string s of length n, and an integer k (1\u2264q k < n).Alice wins if she is able to transform all characters of s into zeroes. If Alice is unable to win in a finite number of moves, then Bob wins.Alice and Bob take turns, with Alice going first. On Alice's turn, she may choose any subsequence^{\\text{\u2217}} of length k in s, then set all characters in that subsequence to zero. On Bob's turn, he may choose any substring^{\\text{\u2020}} of length k in s, then set all characters",

**Problem: 2137_D**

Given an array a, let f(x) be the number of occurrences of x in the array a. For example, when a=[1,2,3,1,4], then f(1)=2 and f(3)=1. You have an array b of size n. Please determine if there is an array a of size n such that f(a_i)=b_i for all 1 ≤q i ≤q n. If there is one, construct it.

**Task:** Please provide a well-structured and optimized C++ solution.

You are a competitive programming expert.

**Problem: 2085_C**

You are given two positive integers x and y (1≤ x, y≤ 10^9).Find a non-negative integer k≤ 10^{18}, such that (x+k) + (y+k) = (x+k)\oplus (y+k) holds^{\text{∗}}, or determine that such an integer does not exist.^{\text{∗}}\oplus denotes the bitwise XOR operation.

**Task:** Please provide a well-structured and optimized C++ solution.

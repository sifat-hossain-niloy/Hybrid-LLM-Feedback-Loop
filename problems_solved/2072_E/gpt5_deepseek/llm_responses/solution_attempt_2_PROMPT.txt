**Problem: 2072_E**

Akito decided to study a new powerful spell. Since it possesses immeasurable strength, it certainly requires a lot of space and careful preparation. For this, Akito went out into the field. Let's represent the field as a Cartesian coordinate system.For the spell, Akito needs to place 0 ≤ n ≤ 500 staffs at distinct integer coordinates in the field such that there will be exactly k pairs (i, j) such that 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n and \rho(i, j) = d(i, j).Here, for two points with integer coordinates a = (x_a, y_a) and b = (x_b, y_b), \rho(a, b) = \sqrt{(x_a - x_b)^2 + (y_a - y_b)^2} and d(a, b) = |x_a - x_b| + |y_a - y_b|.

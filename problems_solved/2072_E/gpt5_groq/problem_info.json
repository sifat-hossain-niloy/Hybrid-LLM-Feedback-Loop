  "statement": "Akito decided to study a new powerful spell. Since it possesses immeasurable strength, it certainly requires a lot of space and careful preparation. For this, Akito went out into the field. Let's represent the field as a Cartesian coordinate system.For the spell, Akito needs to place 0 \u2264 n \u2264 500 staffs at distinct integer coordinates in the field such that there will be exactly k pairs (i, j) such that 1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 n and \\rho(i, j) = d(i, j).Here, for two points with integer coordinates a = (x_a,",

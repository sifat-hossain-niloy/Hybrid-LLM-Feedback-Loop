**Problem: 2148_F**

Farmer John has n arrays a_1, a_2, ..., a_n that may have different lengths. He will stack the arrays on top of each other, resulting in a grid with n rows. The arrays are left-aligned and can be stacked in any order he desires.Then, gravity will take place. Any cell that is not on the bottom row and does not have an element beneath it will fall down a row. This process will be repeated until there are no cells that satisfy the aforementioned constraint.Over all possible ways FJ can stack the arrays, output the lexicographically minimum bottom row after gravity takes place.

  "statement": "A permutation of integers from 1 to n is an array of size n where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly once.You are given a permutation p of integers from 1 to n. You have to process n queries. During the i-th query, you replace p_{d_i} with 0. Each element is replaced with 0 exactly once. The changes made in the queries are saved, that is, after the i-th query, all integers p_{d_1}, p_{d_2}, ..., p_{d_i} are zeroes.After each query, you have to find the minimum number of operations required",

**Problem: 2086_C**

A permutation of integers from 1 to n is an array of size n where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly once.You are given a permutation p of integers from 1 to n. You have to process n queries. During the i-th query, you replace p_{d_i} with 0. Each element is replaced with 0 exactly once. The changes made in the queries are saved, that is, after the i-th query, all integers p_{d_1}, p_{d_2}, ..., p_{d_i} are zeroes.After each query, you have to find the minimum number of operations required to fix the array; in other words, to transform the current array into any permutation of integers from 1 to n (possibly into the original permutation p, possibly into some other permutation).The operation you can perform to fix the array is the following one: choose the integer i from 1 to n, replace the i-th element of the array with i. Note that the answer for each query is calculated independently, meaning you do not actually apply any operations, just calculate the minimum number of operati

**Task:** Please provide a well-structured and optimized C++ solution.

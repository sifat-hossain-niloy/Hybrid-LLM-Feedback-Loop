  "statement": "Recently, Misha at the IT Campus \"NEIMARK\" camp learned a new topic\u00a0\u2014 the Euclidean algorithm.He was somewhat surprised when he realized that a \u00b7 b = lcm(a, b) \u00b7 gcd(a, b), where gcd(a, b)\u00a0\u2014 is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numbers a and b and lcm(a, b)\u00a0\u2014 is the least common multiple (LCM). Misha thought that since the product of LCM and GCD exists, it might be interesting to consider their quotient: F(a,b)=\\frac{lcm(a, b)}{gcd(a, b)}.For example, he took a = 2 and b = 4, computed F(2",

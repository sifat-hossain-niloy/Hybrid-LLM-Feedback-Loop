**Problem: 2123_F**

Call a permutation^{\text{∗}} p of length n good if \gcd(p_i, i)^{\text{†}} > 1 for all 2 ≤q i ≤q n. Find a good permutation with the minimum number of fixed points^{\text{‡}} across all good permutations of length n. If there are multiple such permutations, print any of them.^{\text{∗}} A permutation of length n is an array that contains every integer from 1 to n exactly once, in any order. ^{\text{†}}\gcd(x, y) denotes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of x and y.^{\text{‡}}A fixed point of a permutation p is an index j (1≤q j≤q n) such that p_j = j.

  "statement": "Tired of supporting ranged carries, Keria is now creating a data structure problem about supporting range queries.For an array b = [b_1, b_2, ..., b_m] of length m where b_i=0 or b_i=1, consider the following triple removal operation: Choose three indices 1 \u2264 i < j < k \u2264 m such that the elements at these positions are identical (b_i = b_j = b_k). Remove these three elements from the array. The cost of this operation is defined as \\min(k-j, j-i). After the removal, the remaining parts of the arra",

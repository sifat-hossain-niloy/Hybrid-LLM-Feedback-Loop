  "statement": "For her birthday, each of Asuna's n admirers gifted her a tower. The height of the tower from the i-th admirer is equal to a_i. Asuna evaluates the beauty of the received gifts as \\max(a_1, a_2, ..., a_n). She can perform the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero). Take such 1 \u2264 i \u2260q j \u2264 n that a_i + a_j is odd and a_i > 0, then decrease a_i by 1 and increase a_j by 1. It is easy to see that the heights of the towers remain non-negative during the operations. Help Asun",

**Problem: 2092_C**

For her birthday, each of Asuna's n admirers gifted her a tower. The height of the tower from the i-th admirer is equal to a_i. Asuna evaluates the beauty of the received gifts as \max(a_1, a_2, ..., a_n). She can perform the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero). Take such 1 ≤ i ≠q j ≤ n that a_i + a_j is odd and a_i > 0, then decrease a_i by 1 and increase a_j by 1. It is easy to see that the heights of the towers remain non-negative during the operations. Help Asuna find the maximum possible beauty of the gifts after any number of operations!

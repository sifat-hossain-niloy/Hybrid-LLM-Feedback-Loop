  "statement": "This is the easy version of the problem. The difference between the versions is that in this version, l=0, and r<2\u00b7 10^5. You can hack only if you solved all versions of this problem. You are given two integers l and r (l\u2264 r). Let n = r - l + 1. We will create two arrays a and b, both consisting of n integers. Initially, both a and b are equal to [l, l+1, ..., r]. You have to reorder the array a arbitrarily to maximize the following value:\u2211_{i=1}^n \u2264ft (a_i\\;|\\;b_i \\right ).Here, | denotes the b",

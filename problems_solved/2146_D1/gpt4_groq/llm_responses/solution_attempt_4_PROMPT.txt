**Problem: 2146_D1**

This is the easy version of the problem. The difference between the versions is that in this version, l=0, and r<2· 10^5. You can hack only if you solved all versions of this problem. You are given two integers l and r (l≤ r). Let n = r - l + 1. We will create two arrays a and b, both consisting of n integers. Initially, both a and b are equal to [l, l+1, ..., r]. You have to reorder the array a arbitrarily to maximize the following value:∑_{i=1}^n ≤ft (a_i\;|\;b_i \right ).Here, | denotes the bitwise OR operation. You also need to construct a possible way to reorder the array a.

  "statement": "Akito still has nowhere to live, and the price for a small room is everywhere. For this reason, Akito decided to get a job at a bank as a key creator for storages.In this magical world, everything is different. For example, the key for a storage with the code (n, x) is an array a of length n such that: a_1 \\ | \\ a_2 \\ | \\ a_3 \\ | \\ ... \\ | \\ a_n = x, where a \\ | \\ b is the bitwise \"OR\" of numbers a and b. \\text{MEX}(\\{ a_1, a_2, a_3, ..., a_n \\})^{\\text{\u2217}} is maximized among all such arrays.

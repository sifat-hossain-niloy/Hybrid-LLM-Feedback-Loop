You are a competitive programming expert.

**Problem: 2120_C**

Harshith attained enlightenment in Competitive Programming by training under a Divine Tree. A divine tree is a rooted tree^{\text{∗}} with n nodes, labelled from 1 to n. The divineness of a node v, denoted d(v), is defined as the smallest node label on the unique simple path from the root to node v.Aryan, being a hungry Competitive Programmer, asked Harshith to pass on the knowledge. Harshith agreed on the condition that Aryan would be given two positive integers n and m, and he had to construct a divine tree with n nodes such that the total divineness of the tree is m, i.e., \displaystyle∑\limits_{i=1}^n d(i)=m. If no such tree exists, Aryan must report that it is impossible.Desperate for knowledge, Aryan turned to you for help in completing this task. As a good friend of his, help him solve the task.^{\text{∗}}A tree is a connected graph without cycles. A rooted tree is a tree where one vertex is special and called the root.

**Task:** Please provide a well-structured and optimized C++ solution.

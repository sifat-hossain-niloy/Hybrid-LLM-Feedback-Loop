In the arithmetic competition, participants need to achieve the highest possible sum from the cards they have. In the team "fst_ezik", Vadim has n cards with numbers a_i, and Kostya has m cards with numbers b_i. In each of the q rounds, they want to win, but this time the rules of the competition are slightly different from the usual ones.In each round, the participants are given three numbers x_i, y_i, and z_i. The team "fst_ezik" must choose exactly z_i cards from all the cards they have, but Vadim can choose no more than x_i cards from his set, and Kostya can choose no more than y_i cards from his set. Help them find the highest possible sum for each of the q rounds.

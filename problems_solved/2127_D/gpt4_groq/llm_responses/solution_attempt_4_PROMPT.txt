**Problem: 2127_D**

Heartfall River runs horizontally through Destinyland and divides it into the northern and southern sides.Engineer Root wants to build n houses along the river, numbered from 1 to n. All houses on the northern side and all houses on the southern side must lie along straight lines parallel to Heartfall River.There will be m bridges, with the i-th bridge connecting house u_i and house v_i (u_i ≠ v_i). It is guaranteed that all n houses are connected by these bridges, that is, you can travel from any house to any other by crossing bridges. Also, there are no two bridges connecting the same pair of houses.Root wants to know how many ways there are to arrange the n houses along the river, modulo 10^9+7, such that the following conditions hold for the planned m bridges: For every bridge, the two houses it connects lie on opposite sides of the river; The bridges do not cross when drawn as straight lines between the houses. A possible arrangement of the houses when n=5. Two arrangements are co

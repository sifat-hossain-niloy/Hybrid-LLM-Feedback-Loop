**Problem: 2119_C**

Juggernaut. - Lost Dream feat.星名はる You are given four positive integers n, l, r, k. You need to find the lexicographically smallest^{\text{∗}} array a of length n, consisting of integers, such that: For every 1 ≤q i ≤q n, l ≤q a_i ≤q r. a_1 \, \& \, a_2 \, \& \, ... \, \& \, a_n = a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus ... \oplus a_n, where \& denotes the bitwise AND operation and \oplus denotes the bitwise XOR operation. If no such array exists, output -1. Otherwise, since the entire array might be too large to output, output a_k only.^{\text{∗}}An array a is lexicographically smaller than an array b if and only if one of the following holds: a is a prefix of b, but a ≠ b; or in the first position where a and b differ, the array a has a smaller element than the corresponding element in b.

**Task:** Please provide a well-structured and optimized C++ solution.

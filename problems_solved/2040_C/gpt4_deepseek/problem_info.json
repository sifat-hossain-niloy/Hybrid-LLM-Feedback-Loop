  "statement": "Consider a permutation^{\\text{\u2217}} p_1, p_2, ..., p_n of integers from 1 to n. We can introduce the following sum for it^{\\text{\u2020}}:S(p) = \u2211_{1 \u2264 l \u2264 r \u2264 n} \\min(p_l, p_{l + 1}, ..., p_r)Let us consider all permutations of length n with the maximum possible value of S(p). Output the k-th of them in lexicographical^{\\text{\u2021}}order, or report that there are less than k of them.^{\\text{\u2217}}A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order.

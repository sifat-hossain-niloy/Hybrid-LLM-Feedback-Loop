**Problem: 2040_C**

Consider a permutation^{\text{∗}} p_1, p_2, ..., p_n of integers from 1 to n. We can introduce the following sum for it^{\text{†}}:S(p) = ∑_{1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n} \min(p_l, p_{l + 1}, ..., p_r)Let us consider all permutations of length n with the maximum possible value of S(p). Output the k-th of them in lexicographical^{\text{‡}}order, or report that there are less than k of them.^{\text{∗}}A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array). ^{\text{†}}For example: For the permutation [1, 2, 3] the value of S(p) is equal to \min(1) + \min(1, 2) + \min(1, 2, 3) + \min(2) + \min(2, 3) + \min(3) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 = 10 For the permutation [2, 4, 1, 3] the value of S(p) is equal to \min(2) + \min(2, 4) + \min(2, 4, 1) + \min(2, 4, 1, 3) \ + \min(4) + \min(4, 1)

**Problem: 2132_D**

Vadim wanted to understand the infinite sequence of digits that consists of the positive integers written consecutively from 1 to infinity. That is, this sequence looks like 123456789101112131415 ...To avoid looking into infinity, Vadim cut this sequence at the k-th digit and discarded everything after it. Thus, exactly k digits remained in the sequence. Help him find the sum of the digits in the remaining sequence.

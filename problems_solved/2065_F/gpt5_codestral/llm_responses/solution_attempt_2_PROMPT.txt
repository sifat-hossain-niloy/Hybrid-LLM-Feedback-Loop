**Problem: 2065_F**

Let's define the majority of a sequence of k elements as the unique value that appears strictly more than ≤ft \lfloor {\frac{k}{2}} \right \rfloor times. If such a value does not exist, then the sequence does not have a majority. For example, the sequence [1,3,2,3,3] has a majority 3 because it appears 3 > ≤ft \lfloor {\frac{5}{2}} \right \rfloor = 2 times, but [1,2,3,4,5] and [1,3,2,3,4] do not have a majority.Skibidus found a tree^{\text{∗}} of n vertices and an array a of length n. Vertex i has the value a_i written on it, where a_i is an integer in the range [1, n].For each i from 1 to n, please determine if there exists a non-trivial simple path^{\text{†}} such that i is the majority of the sequence of integers written on the vertices that form the path.^{\text{∗}}A tree is a connected graph without cycles. ^{\text{†}}A sequence of vertices v_1, v_2, ..., v_m (m ≥q 2) forms a non-trivial simple path if v_i and v_{i+1} are connected by an edge for all 1 ≤q i ≤q m - 1 and all v_i ar

**Problem: 2069_C**

Let's call an integer sequence beautiful if the following conditions hold: its length is at least 3; for every element except the first one, there is an element to the left less than it; for every element except the last one, there is an element to the right larger than it; For example, [1, 4, 2, 4, 7] and [1, 2, 4, 8] are beautiful, but [1, 2], [2, 2, 4], and [1, 3, 5, 3] are not.Recall that a subsequence is a sequence that can be obtained from another sequence by removing some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.You are given an integer array a of size n, where every element is from 1 to 3. Your task is to calculate the number of beautiful subsequences of the array a. Since the answer might be large, print it modulo 998244353.

**Problem: 2118_B**

There is a matrix A of size n× n where A_{i,j}=j for all 1 ≤ i,j ≤ n. In one operation, you can select a row and reverse any subarray^{\text{∗}} in it. Find a sequence of at most 2n operations such that every column will contain a permutation^{\text{†}} of length n.It can be proven that the construction is always possible. If there are multiple solutions, output any of them.^{\text{∗}}An array a is a subarray of an array b if a can be obtained from b by deleting zero or more elements from the beginning and zero or more elements from the end.^{\text{†}}A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

**Task:** Please provide a well-structured and optimized C++ solution.

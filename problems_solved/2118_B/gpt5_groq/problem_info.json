  "statement": "There is a matrix A of size n\u00d7 n where A_{i,j}=j for all 1 \u2264 i,j \u2264 n. In one operation, you can select a row and reverse any subarray^{\\text{\u2217}} in it. Find a sequence of at most 2n operations such that every column will contain a permutation^{\\text{\u2020}} of length n.It can be proven that the construction is always possible. If there are multiple solutions, output any of them.^{\\text{\u2217}}An array a is a subarray of an array b if a can be obtained from b by deleting zero or more elements from the be",

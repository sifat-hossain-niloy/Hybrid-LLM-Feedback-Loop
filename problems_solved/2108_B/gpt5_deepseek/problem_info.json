  "statement": "On a recent birthday, your best friend Maurice gave you a pair of numbers n and x, and asked you to construct an array of positive numbers a of length n such that a_1 \\oplus a_2 \\oplus \u00b7s \\oplus a_n = x ^{\\text{\u2217}}. This task seemed too simple to you, and therefore you decided to give Maurice a return gift by constructing an array among all such arrays that has the smallest sum of its elements. You immediately thought of a suitable array; however, since writing it down turned out to be too time-",

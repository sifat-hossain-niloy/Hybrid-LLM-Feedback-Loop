**Problem: 2143_C**

You are given a tree consisting of n vertices, numbered from 1 to n. Each of the n - 1 edges is associated with two non-negative integers x and y.Consider a permutation^{\text{∗}} p of the integers 1 through n, where p_i represents the value assigned to vertex i.For an edge (u, v), such that u < v with associated values x and y, its contribution is defined as follows: \begin{cases} x & \text{if } p_u > p_v, \\ y & \text{otherwise.} \end{cases} The value of the permutation is the sum of the contributions from all edges.Your task is to find any permutation p that maximizes this total value.^{\text{∗}}A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

  "statement": "You are given a tree consisting of n vertices, numbered from 1 to n. Each of the n - 1 edges is associated with two non-negative integers x and y.Consider a permutation^{\\text{\u2217}} p of the integers 1 through n, where p_i represents the value assigned to vertex i.For an edge (u, v), such that u < v with associated values x and y, its contribution is defined as follows: \\begin{cases} x & \\text{if } p_u > p_v, \\\\ y & \\text{otherwise.} \\end{cases} The value of the permutation is the sum of the contr",

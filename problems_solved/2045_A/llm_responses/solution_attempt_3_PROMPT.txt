# Problem

## Problem Statement

You are playing a word game using a standard set of
26
uppercase English letters: A — Z. In this game, you can form vowels and consonants as follows.
The letters A, E, I, O, and U can only form a vowel.
The letter Y can form either a vowel or a consonant.
Each of the remaining letters other than A, E, I, O, U, and Y can only form a consonant.
The string NG can form a single consonant when concatenated together.
Denote a syllable as a concatenation of a consonant, a vowel, and a consonant in that order. A word is a concatenation of one or more syllables.
You are given a string
S
and you want to create a word from it. You are allowed to delete zero or more letters from
S
and rearrange the remaining letters to form the word. Find the length of the longest word that can be created, or determine if no words can be created.

## Input

A single line consisting of a string
S
(
1≤|S|≤5000
). The string
S
consists of only uppercase English letters.

## Output

If a word cannot be created, output 0. Otherwise, output a single integer representing the length of longest word that can be created.

## Note

Explanation for the sample input/output #1
A possible longest word is JAKCARTAP, consisting of the syllables JAK, CAR, and TAP.
Explanation for the sample input/output #2
The whole string
S
is a word consisting of one syllable which is the concatenation of the consonant NG, the vowel E, and the consonant NG.
Explanation for the sample input/output #3
The whole string
S
is a word consisting of one syllable which is the concatenation of the consonant Y, the vowel Y, and the consonant Y.
Explanation for the sample input/output #4
The whole string
𝑆
is a word consisting of two syllables: DAN and GAN.

🔍 DEBUGGING HINT FROM CODESTRAL:
Let's analyze the failed solution and identify the issues:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to form syllables (consonant-vowel-consonant) from the given string.
   - The string can be rearranged and letters can be deleted.
   - We need to find the maximum length of such a word.

2. **Analysis of the Failed Solution**:
   - The code counts vowels, 'Y', 'NG', and other consonants.
   - It checks if a word can be formed based on these counts.
   - The logic for calculating the maximum length seems flawed.

3. **Issues Identified**:
   - The condition `vowels + y + min(y, others) < 2` might be too restrictive.
   - The calculation of `t` and the final output formula might not correctly represent the maximum possible word length.
   - The code doesn't account for the fact that 'Y' can be used as both a vowel and a consonant in different syllables.

4. **Hints for Fixing the Solution**:
   - Focus on counting the maximum number of syllables that can be formed.
   - For each syllable, you need one vowel, one consonant, and one consonant.
   - Consider that 'Y' can be used as a vowel or a consonant, but not both in the same syllable.
   - 'NG' counts as a single consonant.
   - The maximum number of syllables is limited by the smallest of the counts of vowels, consonants, and consonants.
   - The maximum word length is then 3 times the number of syllables.

5. **Edge Cases to Consider**:
   - Strings with only vowels or only consonants.
   - Strings with only 'Y' or 'NG'.
   - Strings with a combination of all types of letters.

6. **Suggested Approach**:
   - Count the number of vowels, consonants, and consonants (including 'NG').
   - The maximum number of syllables is the minimum of these counts.
   - The maximum word length is 3 times the number of syllables.

7. **Algorithmic Improvements**:
   - The current approach is already quite efficient with O(n) time complexity.
   - Focus on accurate counting and correct logic for syllable formation.

8. **Final Hint**:
   - The key is to correctly count the available vowels, consonants, and consonants, and then determine the maximum number of syllables that can be formed. The maximum word length is then 3 times the number of syllables. Make sure to handle 'Y' and 'NG' appropriately.

3. **Issues Identified**:
   - The calculation of `consonants` might be incorrect. It should be `s.size() - vowels - y - 2 * ng` because 'NG' counts as a single consonant.
   - The formula for `syllables` might not correctly represent the maximum number of syllables that can be formed.
   - The code doesn't account for the fact that 'Y' can be used as both a vowel and a consonant in different syllables.

4. **Hints for Fixing the Solution**:
   - Correct the calculation of `consonants` to account for 'NG' as a single consonant.

Double-check the code for any syntax errors.

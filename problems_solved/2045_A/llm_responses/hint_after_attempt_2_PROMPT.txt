Problem Statement:
# Problem

## Problem Statement

You are playing a word game using a standard set of
26
uppercase English letters: A — Z. In this game, you can form vowels and consonants as follows.
The letters A, E, I, O, and U can only form a vowel.
The letter Y can form either a vowel or a consonant.
Each of the remaining letters other than A, E, I, O, U, and Y can only form a consonant.
The string NG can form a single consonant when concatenated together.
Denote a syllable as a concatenation of a consonant, a vowel, and a consonant in that order. A word is a concatenation of one or more syllables.
You are given a string
S
and you want to create a word from it. You are allowed to delete zero or more letters from
S
and rearrange the remaining letters to form the word. Find the length of the longest word that can be created, or determine if no words can be created.

## Input

A single line consisting of a string
S
(
1≤|S|≤5000
). The string
S
consists of only uppercase English letters.

## Output

If a word cannot be created, output 0. Otherwise, output a single integer representing the length of longest word that can be created.

## Note

Explanation for the sample input/output #1
A possible longest word is JAKCARTAP, consisting of the syllables JAK, CAR, and TAP.
Explanation for the sample input/output #2
The whole string
S
is a word consisting of one syllable which is the concatenation of the consonant NG, the vowel E, and the consonant NG.
Explanation for the sample input/output #3
The whole string
S
is a word consisting of one syllable which is the concatenation of the consonant Y, the vowel Y, and the consonant Y.
Explanation for the sample input/output #4
The whole string
𝑆
is a word consisting of two syllables: DAN and GAN.

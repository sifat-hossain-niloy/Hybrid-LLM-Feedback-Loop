You are a competitive programming expert.

**Problem: 2045_A**

You are playing a word game using a standard set of 26 uppercase English letters: A — Z. In this game, you can form vowels and consonants as follows. The letters A, E, I, O, and U can only form a vowel. The letter Y can form either a vowel or a consonant. Each of the remaining letters other than A, E, I, O, U, and Y can only form a consonant. The string NG can form a single consonant when concatenated together. Denote a syllable as a concatenation of a consonant, a vowel, and a consonant in that order. A word is a concatenation of one or more syllables.You are given a string S and you want to create a word from it. You are allowed to delete zero or more letters from S and rearrange the remaining letters to form the word. Find the length of the longest word that can be created, or determine if no words can be created.

**Task:** Please provide a well-structured and optimized C++ solution.

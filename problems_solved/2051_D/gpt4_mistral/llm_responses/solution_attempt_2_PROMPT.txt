You are a competitive programming expert.

**Problem: 2051_D**

You are given a sequence a, consisting of n integers, where the i-th element of the sequence is equal to a_i. You are also given two integers x and y (x ≤ y).A pair of integers (i, j) is considered interesting if the following conditions are met: 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n; if you simultaneously remove the elements at positions i and j from the sequence a, the sum of the remaining elements is at least x and at most y. Your task is to determine the number of interesting pairs of integers for the given sequence a.

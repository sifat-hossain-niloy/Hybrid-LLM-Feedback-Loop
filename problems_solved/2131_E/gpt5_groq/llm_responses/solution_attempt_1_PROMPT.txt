You are a competitive programming expert.

**Problem: 2131_E**

You're given an array a of length n. For each index i such that 1 ≤ i < n, you can perform the following operation at most once: Assign a_i := a_i \oplus a_{i+1}, where \oplus denotes the bitwise XOR operation. . You can choose indices and perform the operations in any sequential order.Given another array b of length n, determine if it is possible to transform a to b.

**Task:** Please provide a well-structured and optimized C++ solution.

  "statement": "This is the easy version of the problem. The difference between the versions is that in this version, b_i = 1 for all i (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n). You can hack only if you solved all versions of this problem. You find yourself with two arrays of positive integers a and b, both of length n. You will perform the following operation any number of times (possibly none): select an integer i (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n) and increase a_i by 1. This has a cost of b_i. Determine the minimum total cost to make it so that there exists t",

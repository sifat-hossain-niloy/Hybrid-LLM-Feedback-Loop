You are a competitive programming expert.

**Problem: 2154_C1**

This is the easy version of the problem. The difference between the versions is that in this version, b_i = 1 for all i (1 ≤ i ≤ n). You can hack only if you solved all versions of this problem. You find yourself with two arrays of positive integers a and b, both of length n. You will perform the following operation any number of times (possibly none): select an integer i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) and increase a_i by 1. This has a cost of b_i. Determine the minimum total cost to make it so that there exists two integers i, j where 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n and \gcd(a_i, a_j)^{\text{∗}} > 1.^{\text{∗}}\gcd(x, y) denotes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of integers x and y.

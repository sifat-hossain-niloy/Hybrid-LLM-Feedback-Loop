In the i-th operation, you must choose any point such that the Euclidean distance^{\\text{\u2217}} between your current position and the point is exactly a_i, and then move to that point.Determine whether it is possible to reach the terminal point (q_x,q_y) after performing all operations.^{\\text{\u2217}}The Euclidean dist",

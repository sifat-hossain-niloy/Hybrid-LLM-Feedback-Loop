**Problem: 2094_F**

Trulicina gives you integers n, m, and k. It is guaranteed that k≥q 2 and n· m≡ 0 ±od{k}.Output a n by m grid of integers such that each of the following criteria hold: Each integer in the grid is between 1 and k, inclusive. Each integer from 1 to k appears an equal number of times. No two cells that share an edge have the same integer. It can be shown that such a grid always exists. If there are multiple solutions, output any.

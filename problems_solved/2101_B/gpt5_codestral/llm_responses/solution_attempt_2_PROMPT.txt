**Problem: 2101_B**

You are given a permutation a of length n^{\text{∗}}. You are allowed to do the following operation any number of times (possibly zero): Choose an index 1≤ i≤ n - 3. Then, swap a_i with a_{i + 2}, and a_{i + 1} with a_{i + 3} simultaneously. In other words, permutation a will be transformed from [..., a_i, a_{i+1}, a_{i+2}, a_{i+3}, ...] to [..., a_{i+2}, a_{i+3}, a_{i}, a_{i+1}, ...]. Determine the lexicographically smallest permutation^{\text{†}} that can be obtained by applying the above operation any number of times.^{\text{∗}}A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array). ^{\text{†}}An array x is lexicographically smaller than an array y of the same size if and only if the following holds: in the first position where x and y differ, the array x ha

  "statement": "You are given a permutation a of length n^{\\text{\u2217}}. You are allowed to do the following operation any number of times (possibly zero): Choose an index 1\u2264 i\u2264 n - 3. Then, swap a_i with a_{i + 2}, and a_{i + 1} with a_{i + 3} simultaneously. In other words, permutation a will be transformed from [..., a_i, a_{i+1}, a_{i+2}, a_{i+3}, ...] to [..., a_{i+2}, a_{i+3}, a_{i}, a_{i+1}, ...]. Determine the lexicographically smallest permutation^{\\text{\u2020}} that can be obtained by applying the above oper",

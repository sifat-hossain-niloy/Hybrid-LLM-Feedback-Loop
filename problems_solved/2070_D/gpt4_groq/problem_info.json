  "statement": "You are given a rooted tree, consisting of n vertices. The vertices in the tree are numbered from 1 to n, and the root is the vertex 1. Let d_x be the distance (the number of edges on the shortest path) from the root to the vertex x.There is a chip that is initially placed at the root. You can perform the following operation as many times as you want (possibly zero): move the chip from the current vertex v to a vertex u such that d_u = d_v + 1. If v is the root, you can choose any vertex u meeti",

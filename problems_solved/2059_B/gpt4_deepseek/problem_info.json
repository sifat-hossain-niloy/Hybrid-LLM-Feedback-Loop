  "statement": "You are given an array a of length n and an even integer k (2 \u2264 k \u2264 n). You need to split the array a into exactly k non-empty subarrays^{\\dagger} such that each element of the array a belongs to exactly one subarray.Next, all subarrays with even indices (second, fourth, ..., k-th) are concatenated into a single array b. After that, 0 is added to the end of the array b.The cost of the array b is defined as the minimum index i such that b_i \u2260q i. For example, the cost of the array b = [1, 2, 4, 5",

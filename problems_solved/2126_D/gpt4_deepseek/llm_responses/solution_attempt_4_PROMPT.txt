You are given n casinos, numbered from 1 to n. Each casino is described by three integers: l_i, r_i, and real_i (l_i ≤ real_i ≤ r_i). You initially have k coins.You can play at casino i only if the current number of coins x satisfies l_i ≤ x ≤ r_i. After playing, your number of coins becomes real_i.You can visit the casinos in any order and are not required to visit all of them. Each casino can be visited no more than once.Your task is to find the maximum final number of coins you can obtain.

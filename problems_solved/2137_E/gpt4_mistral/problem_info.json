You do the following procedure k times: For each element a_i, you set a_i to \\operatorname{mex}^{\\text{\u2217}}(a_1,a_2,...,a_{i-1},a_{i+1},a_{i+2}, ...,a_n). In other words, you set a_i to the \\operatorname{mex} of all other elements in the array. This is done for all elements in the array at the same time. Please find the sum of elements in the array after all k operations. ^{\\text{\u2217}}The minimum excluded (MEX) of a collection of integers d_1, d_",

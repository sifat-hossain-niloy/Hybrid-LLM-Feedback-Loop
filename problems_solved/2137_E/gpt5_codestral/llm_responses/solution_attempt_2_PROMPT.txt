You are a competitive programming expert.

**Problem: 2137_E**

You are given an array a of size n and an integer k. You do the following procedure k times: For each element a_i, you set a_i to \operatorname{mex}^{\text{∗}}(a_1,a_2,...,a_{i-1},a_{i+1},a_{i+2}, ...,a_n). In other words, you set a_i to the \operatorname{mex} of all other elements in the array. This is done for all elements in the array at the same time. Please find the sum of elements in the array after all k operations. ^{\text{∗}}The minimum excluded (MEX) of a collection of integers d_1, d_2, ..., d_k is defined as the smallest non-negative integer x which does not occur in the collection d.

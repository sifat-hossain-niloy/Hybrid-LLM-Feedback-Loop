  "statement": "Gellyfish hates math problems, but she has to finish her math homework:Gellyfish is given an array of n positive integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n.She needs to do the following two-step operation until all elements of a are equal: Select two indexes i, j satisfying 1 \u2264q i, j \u2264q n and i \u2260q j. Replace a_i with \\gcd(a_i, a_j). Now, Gellyfish asks you for the minimum number of operations to achieve her goal.It can be proven that Gellyfish can always achieve her goal.",

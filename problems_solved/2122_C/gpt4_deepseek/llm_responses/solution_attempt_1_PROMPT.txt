You are a competitive programming expert.

**Problem: 2122_C**

You are given n points (x_i, y_i) on a 2D plane, where n is even. Select \tfrac{n}{2} disjoint pairs (a_i, b_i) to maximize the sum of Manhattan distances between points in pairs. In other words, maximize ∑_{i=1}^{n/2} |x_{a_i} - x_{b_i}| + |y_{a_i} - y_{b_i}|.

**Task:** Please provide a well-structured and optimized C++ solution.

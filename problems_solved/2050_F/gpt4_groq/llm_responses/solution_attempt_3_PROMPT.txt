You are a competitive programming expert.

**Problem: 2050_F**

You are given an array a of length n and q queries l, r.For each query, find the maximum possible m, such that all elements a_l, a_{l+1}, ..., a_r are equal modulo m. In other words, a_l \bmod m = a_{l+1} \bmod m = ... = a_r \bmod m, where a \bmod b — is the remainder of division a by b. In particular, when m can be infinite, print 0.

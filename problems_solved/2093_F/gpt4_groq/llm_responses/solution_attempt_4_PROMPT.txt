**Problem: 2093_F**

Hackers are once again trying to create entertaining phrases using the output of neural networks. This time, they want to obtain an array of strings a of length n.Initially, they have an array c of length n, filled with blanks, which are denoted by the symbol *. Thus, if n=4, then initially c=[*,*,*,*].The hackers have access to m neural networks, each of which has its own version of the answer to their request – an array of strings b_i of length n.The hackers are trying to obtain the array a from the array c using the following operations: Choose a neural network i, which will perform the next operation on the array c: it will select a random blank, for example, at position j, and replace c_j with b_{i, j}.For example, if the first neural network is chosen and c = [*, \text{«like»}, *], and b_1 = [\text{«I»}, \text{«love»}, \text{«apples»}], then after the operation with the first neural network, c may become either [\text{«I»}, \text{«like»}, *] or [*, \text{«like»}, \text{«apples»}]

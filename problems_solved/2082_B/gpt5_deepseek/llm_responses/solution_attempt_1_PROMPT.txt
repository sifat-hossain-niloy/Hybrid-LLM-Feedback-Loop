**Problem: 2082_B**

Ecrade has an integer x. There are two kinds of operations. Replace x with ≤ft\lfloor \dfrac{x}{2}\right\rfloor, where ≤ft\lfloor \dfrac{x}{2}\right\rfloor is the greatest integer ≤ \dfrac{x}{2}. Replace x with ≤ft\lceil \dfrac{x}{2}\right\rceil, where ≤ft\lceil \dfrac{x}{2}\right\rceil is the smallest integer ≥ \dfrac{x}{2}. Ecrade will perform exactly n first operations and m second operations in any order. He wants to know the minimum and the maximum possible value of x after n+m operations. However, it seems a little difficult, so please help him!

**Task:** Please provide a well-structured and optimized C++ solution.

  "statement": "Ecrade has an integer x. There are two kinds of operations. Replace x with \u2264ft\\lfloor \\dfrac{x}{2}\\right\\rfloor, where \u2264ft\\lfloor \\dfrac{x}{2}\\right\\rfloor is the greatest integer \u2264 \\dfrac{x}{2}. Replace x with \u2264ft\\lceil \\dfrac{x}{2}\\right\\rceil, where \u2264ft\\lceil \\dfrac{x}{2}\\right\\rceil is the smallest integer \u2265 \\dfrac{x}{2}. Ecrade will perform exactly n first operations and m second operations in any order. He wants to know the minimum and the maximum possible value of x after n+m operations. ",

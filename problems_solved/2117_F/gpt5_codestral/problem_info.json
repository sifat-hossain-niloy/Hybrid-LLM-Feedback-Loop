  "statement": "Yousef has a rooted tree^{\\text{\u2217}} consisting of exactly n vertices, which is rooted at vertex 1. You would like to give Yousef an array a of length n, where each a_i (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n) can either be 1 or 2.Let s_u denote the sum of a_v where vertex v is in the subtree^{\\text{\u2020}} of vertex u. Yousef considers the tree special if all the values in s are pairwise distinct (i.e., all subtree sums are unique).Your task is to help Yousef count the number of different arrays a that result in the tree being ",

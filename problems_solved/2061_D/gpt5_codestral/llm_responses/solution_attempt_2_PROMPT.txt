**Problem: 2061_D**

Kevin wrote an integer sequence a of length n on the blackboard.Kevin can perform the following operation any number of times: Select two integers x, y on the blackboard such that |x - y| ≤q 1, erase them, and then write down an integer x + y instead. Kevin wants to know if it is possible to transform these integers into an integer sequence b of length m through some sequence of operations.Two sequences a and b are considered the same if and only if their multisets are identical. In other words, for any number x, the number of times it appears in a must be equal to the number of times it appears in b.

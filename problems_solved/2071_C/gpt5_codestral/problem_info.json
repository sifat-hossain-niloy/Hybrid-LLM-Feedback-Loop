  "statement": "In an Italian village, a hungry mouse starts at vertex \\textrm{st} on a given tree^{\\text{\u2217}} with n vertices.Given a permutation p of length n^{\\text{\u2020}}, there are n steps. For the i-th step: A tempting piece of Parmesan cheese appears at vertex p_i. If the mouse is currently at vertex p_i, it will stay there and enjoy the moment. Otherwise, it will move along the simple path to vertex p_i by one edge. Your task is to find such a permutation so that, after all n steps, the mouse inevitably arr",

  "statement": "Kagari is preparing to archive a tree, and she knows the cost of doing so will depend on its diameter^{\\text{\u2217}}. To keep the expense down, her goal is to shrink the diameter as much as possible first. She can perform the following operation on the tree: Choose two vertices s and t. Let the sequence of vertices on the simple path^{\\text{\u2020}} from s to t be v_0, v_1, ..., v_k, where v_0 = s and v_k = t. Remove all edges along the path. In other words, remove edges (v_0, v_1), (v_1, v_2), ..., (v_{",

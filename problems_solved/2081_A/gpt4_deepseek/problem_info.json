  "statement": "Ecrade has an integer x. He will show you this number in the form of a binary number of length n.There are two kinds of operations. Replace x with \u2264ft\\lfloor \\dfrac{x}{2}\\right\\rfloor, where \u2264ft\\lfloor \\dfrac{x}{2}\\right\\rfloor is the greatest integer \u2264 \\dfrac{x}{2}. Replace x with \u2264ft\\lceil \\dfrac{x}{2}\\right\\rceil, where \u2264ft\\lceil \\dfrac{x}{2}\\right\\rceil is the smallest integer \u2265 \\dfrac{x}{2}. Ecrade will perform several operations until x becomes 1. Each time, he will independently choose to",

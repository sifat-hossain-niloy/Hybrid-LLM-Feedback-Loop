**Problem: 2081_A**

Ecrade has an integer x. He will show you this number in the form of a binary number of length n.There are two kinds of operations. Replace x with ≤ft\lfloor \dfrac{x}{2}\right\rfloor, where ≤ft\lfloor \dfrac{x}{2}\right\rfloor is the greatest integer ≤ \dfrac{x}{2}. Replace x with ≤ft\lceil \dfrac{x}{2}\right\rceil, where ≤ft\lceil \dfrac{x}{2}\right\rceil is the smallest integer ≥ \dfrac{x}{2}. Ecrade will perform several operations until x becomes 1. Each time, he will independently choose to perform either the first operation or the second operation with probability \frac{1}{2}.Ecrade wants to know the expected number of operations he will perform to make x equal to 1, modulo 10^9 + 7. However, it seems a little difficult, so please help him!

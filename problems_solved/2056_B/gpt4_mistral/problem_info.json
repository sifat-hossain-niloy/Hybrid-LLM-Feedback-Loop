This graph encodes a hidden permutation^{\\text{\u2217}} p of size n.\u00a0The\u00a0graph\u00a0is\u00a0constructed as follows: For every pair of integers 1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 n, an undirected edge is added between vertex p_i and vertex p_j if and only if p_i < p_j. Note that the edge is not added between vertices i and j, but between the vertices of their respective elements. Refer to the notes section for better understanding. Your task is to reconstruct and",

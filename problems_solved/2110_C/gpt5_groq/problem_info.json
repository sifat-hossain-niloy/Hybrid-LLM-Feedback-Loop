  "statement": "In 2077, a sport called hobby-droning is gaining popularity among robots.You already have a drone, and you want to win. For this, your drone needs to fly through a course with n obstacles.The i-th obstacle is defined by two numbers l_i, r_i. Let the height of your drone at the i-th obstacle be h_i. Then the drone passes through this obstacle if l_i \u2264 h_i \u2264 r_i. Initially, the drone is on the ground, meaning h_0 = 0.The flight program for the drone is represented by an array d_1, d_2, ..., d_n, w",

  "statement": "For a set of pairs S = \\{(a_1, b_1), (a_2, b_2), ..., (a_m, b_m)\\}, where a_i < b_i for all 1 \u2264 i \u2264 m, we define f(S) and g(S) as follows: Treating each (a_i, b_i) as a segment on the number line, f(S) is the length of their union. Formally, f(S) is the number of integers x such that there exists an i (1 \u2264q i \u2264q m) where [x, x+1] \u2282eq [a_i, b_i]. Treating each (a_i, b_i) as an undirected edge in a graph, g(S) is the number of nodes that lie on at least one simple cycle with at least 3 edges. Form",

**Problem: 2162_D**

This is an interactive problem.There is a permutation^{\text{∗}} p of length n.Someone secretly chose two integers l, r (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) and modified the permutation in the following way: For every index i such that l ≤ i ≤ r, set p_i := p_i + 1. Let a denote the resulting array obtained by modifying the permutation.You are given an integer n denoting the length of the permutation p.In one query, you are allowed to choose two integers l, r (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) and ask for the sum of the subarray either of the original permutation p[l ... r] or of the modified array a[l ... r]. The answer to such a query will be the corresponding integer sum.Your task is to find the pair (l, r) that was chosen to obtain a in no more than \bf{40} queries.^{\text{∗}}A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in any order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (the number 2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is also not a permut

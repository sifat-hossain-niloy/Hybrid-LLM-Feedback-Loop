  "statement": "This is an interactive problem.There is a permutation^{\\text{\u2217}} p of length n.Someone secretly chose two integers l, r (1 \u2264 l \u2264 r \u2264 n) and modified the permutation in the following way: For every index i such that l \u2264 i \u2264 r, set p_i := p_i + 1. Let a denote the resulting array obtained by modifying the permutation.You are given an integer n denoting the length of the permutation p.In one query, you are allowed to choose two integers l, r (1 \u2264 l \u2264 r \u2264 n) and ask for the sum of the subarray eithe",

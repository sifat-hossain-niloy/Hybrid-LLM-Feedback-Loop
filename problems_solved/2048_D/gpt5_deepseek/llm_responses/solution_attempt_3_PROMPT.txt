**Problem: 2048_D**

Kevin used to get into Rio's Memories, and in Rio's Memories, a series of contests was once held. Kevin remembers all the participants and all the contest problems from that time, but he has forgotten the specific rounds, the distribution of problems, and the exact rankings.There are m problems in total, with the i -th problem having a difficulty of b_i . Let each contest consist of k problems, resulting in a total of \lfloor \frac{m}{k} \rfloor contests. This means that you select exactly \lfloor \frac{m}{k} \rfloor · k problems for the contests in any combination you want, with each problem being selected at most once, and the remaining m\bmod k problems are left unused. For example, if m = 17 and k = 3, you should create exactly 5 contests consisting of 3 problems each, and exactly 2 problems will be left unused.There are n participants in the contests, with Kevin being the 1-st participant. The i -th participant has a rating of a_i . During the contests, each participant solves all

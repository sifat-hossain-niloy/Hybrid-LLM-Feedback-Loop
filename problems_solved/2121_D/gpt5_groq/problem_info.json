  "statement": "You are given two arrays of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n and b_1, b_2, ..., b_n. It is guaranteed that each integer from 1 to 2 \u00b7 n appears in exactly one of the arrays.You need to perform a certain number of operations (possibly zero) so that both of the following conditions are satisfied: For each 1 \u2264q i < n, it holds that a_i < a_{i + 1} and b_i < b_{i + 1}. For each 1 \u2264q i \u2264q n, it holds that a_i < b_i. During each operation, you can perform exactly one of the following three actions: Choose ",

**Problem: 2121_E**

For two integers a and b, we define f(a, b) as the number of positions in the decimal representation of the numbers a and b where their digits are the same. For example, f(12, 21) = 0, f(31, 37) = 1, f(19891, 18981) = 2, f(54321, 24361) = 3.You are given two integers l and r of the same length in decimal representation. Consider all integers l ≤q x ≤q r. Your task is to find the minimum value of f(l, x) + f(x, r).

**Task:** Please provide a well-structured and optimized C++ solution.

  "statement": "You are given a matrix of integers with n rows and m columns. The cell at the intersection of the i-th row and the j-th column contains the number a_{ij}.You can perform the following operation exactly once: Choose two numbers 1 \u2264q r \u2264q n and 1 \u2264q c \u2264q m. For all cells (i, j) in the matrix such that i = r or j = c, decrease a_{ij} by one.You need to find the minimal possible maximum value in the matrix a after performing exactly one such operation.",

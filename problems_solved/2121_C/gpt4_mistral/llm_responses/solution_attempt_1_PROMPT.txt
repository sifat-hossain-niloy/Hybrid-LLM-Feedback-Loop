You are a competitive programming expert.

**Problem: 2121_C**

You are given a matrix of integers with n rows and m columns. The cell at the intersection of the i-th row and the j-th column contains the number a_{ij}.You can perform the following operation exactly once: Choose two numbers 1 ≤q r ≤q n and 1 ≤q c ≤q m. For all cells (i, j) in the matrix such that i = r or j = c, decrease a_{ij} by one.You need to find the minimal possible maximum value in the matrix a after performing exactly one such operation.

**Task:** Please provide a well-structured and optimized C++ solution.

**Problem: 2072_D**

Akito got tired of being a simple locksmith at a bank, so he decided to enroll in the Magical Academy and become the best wizard in the world! However, to enroll, he needed to solve a single problem on the exam, which the ambitious hero could not manage.In the problem, he was given an array a of length n. He needed to minimize the number of inversions^{\text{∗}} in the array after applying the spell exactly once. The spell was simple; to apply it, Akito had to choose two numbers l and r such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n and perform a cyclic shift of the subarray from l to r one position to the left.More formally, Akito selects the subarray [l, r] and modifies the array as follows: From the original array [a_1, a_2, ..., a_{l - 1}, \mathbf{ a_l }, \mathbf{ a_{l + 1} } , \mathbf{ ... }, \mathbf{ a_{r - 1} }, \mathbf{ a_r }, a_{r + 1}, ..., a_{n - 1}, a_n], he obtains the array [a_1, a_2, ..., a_{l - 1}, \mathbf{ a_{l + 1} }, \mathbf{ a_{l + 2} }, \mathbf{ ... }, \mathbf{ a_{r - 1} }, \mathbf{ a_{r

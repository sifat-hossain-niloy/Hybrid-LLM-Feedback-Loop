  "statement": "You would like to construct a string s, consisting of lowercase Latin letters, such that the following condition holds: For every pair of indices i and j such that s_{i} = s_{j}, the difference of these indices is even, that is, |i - j| \\bmod 2 = 0. Constructing any string is too easy, so you will be given an array c of 26 numbers\u00a0\u2014 the required number of occurrences of each individual letter in the string s. So, for every i \u2208 [1, 26], the i-th letter of the Latin alphabet should occur exactly c",

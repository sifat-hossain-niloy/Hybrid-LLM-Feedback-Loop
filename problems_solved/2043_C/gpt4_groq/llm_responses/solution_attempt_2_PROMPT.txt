PROBLEM STATEMENT:
======================================================================

You are given an array a of n integers, where all elements except for at most one are equal to -1 or 1. The remaining element x satisfies -10^9 ≤ x ≤ 10^9.Find all possible sums of subarrays of a, including the empty subarray, whose sum is defined as 0. In other words, find all integers x such that the array a has at least one subarray (possibly empty) with sum equal to x. A subarray is a contiguous subsegment of an array.Output these sums in ascending order. Each sum should be printed only once, even if it is achieved by multiple subarrays.

🔍 DEBUGGING HINT:
# Step-by-step analysis of the problem:
1. **Understanding the problem requirements**: The task is to find all possible sums of subarrays of a given array, including the empty subarray, whose sum is defined as 0. The array contains integers, where all elements except for at most one are equal to -1 or 1.
2. **Analyzing the failed solution**: The provided solution attempts to calculate the possible sums by iterating over the array and counting the occurrences of 1 and -1. It also keeps track of the maximum and minimum values encountered.
3. **Identifying the root cause of the failure**: The issue lies in the way the solution generates the possible sums. It only considers the sums that can be obtained by adding the count of 1s and -1s to the minimum and maximum values. However, this approach is incomplete and does not account for all possible subarray sums.
4. **Missing consideration of subarray sums**: The solution does not consider the sums of subarrays that can be obtained by combining the 1s and -1s in different ways. For example, it does not account for the sum of a subarray that contains only 1s or only -1s.

# Fixed solution:
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);

    int t;
    cin >> t;
    while (t--) {
        int n;
        cin >> n;
        vector<int> a(n);
        set<int> sums;
        sums.insert(0); // Initialize with 0 for the empty subarray

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            cin >> a[i];
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int sum = 0;
            for (int j = i; j < n; j++) {
                sum += a[j];
                sums.insert(sum);
            }
        }

        vector<int> result(sums.begin(), sums.end());
        sort(result.begin(), result.end());

        cout << result.size() << endl;
        for (int num : result) {
            cout << num << " ";
        }
        cout << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

# Explanation of changes:
*   **Iterate over all possible subarrays**: Instead of only considering the counts of 1s and -1s, the revised solution iterates over all possible subarrays of the given array.
*   **Calculate the sum of each subarray**: For each subarray, the solution calculates its sum and adds it to the set of possible sums.
*   **Use a set to store unique sums**: The solution uses a set to store the possible sums, ensuring that each sum is only added once.
*   **Sort the sums before output**: Finally, the solution sorts the possible sums in ascending order before outputting them.

# Tests and example uses:
You can test the revised solution with the provided sample inputs to verify its correctness. For example, you can use the following input:
```
5
5
1 -1 10 1 1
5
-1 -1 -1 -1 -1
2
-1 2
2
7 1
3
1 4 -1
```
The output should match the expected answers:
```
8
-1 0 1 2 9 10 11 12
6
-5 -4 -3 -2 -1 0
4
-1 0 1 2
4
0 1 7 8
6
-1 0 1 3 4 5
```

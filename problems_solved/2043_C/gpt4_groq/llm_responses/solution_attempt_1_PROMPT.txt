PROBLEM STATEMENT:
======================================================================

You are given an array a of n integers, where all elements except for at most one are equal to -1 or 1. The remaining element x satisfies -10^9 ≤ x ≤ 10^9.Find all possible sums of subarrays of a, including the empty subarray, whose sum is defined as 0. In other words, find all integers x such that the array a has at least one subarray (possibly empty) with sum equal to x. A subarray is a contiguous subsegment of an array.Output these sums in ascending order. Each sum should be printed only once, even if it is achieved by multiple subarrays.

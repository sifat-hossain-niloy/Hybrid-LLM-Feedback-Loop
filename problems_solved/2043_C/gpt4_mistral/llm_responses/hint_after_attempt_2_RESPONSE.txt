Verdict: Wrong answer on test 1

======================================================================

Let's analyze the failure and identify the issues:

1. **Root Cause Analysis**:
   - The main issue is that the code doesn't properly account for all possible subarray sums, especially those involving the special element x.
   - The code only considers sums based on the count of 1s, which is incorrect for arrays with -1s and the special element x.
   - The handling of the special element x is incomplete and doesn't cover all possible cases.

2. **Specific Hints**:
   - **Subarray Sum Calculation**: Instead of just counting 1s, you need to calculate all possible subarray sums by iterating through the array and maintaining a running sum.
   - **Special Element Handling**: When you find the special element x, you need to consider all possible sums that can be formed by adding x to any existing subarray sum, not just the sums based on the count of 1s.
   - **Initial Sum**: Start with sum = 0 to account for the empty subarray.
   - **Sorting and Deduplication**: After collecting all possible sums, sort them and remove duplicates before printing.

3. **Edge Cases to Consider**:
   - Arrays with only one element (the special element x).
   - Arrays where all elements are -1 or 1.
   - Arrays with multiple special elements (though the problem states at most one).

4. **Algorithmic Improvements**:
   - Use a set to store sums to automatically handle deduplication.
   - Calculate all possible subarray sums by iterating through the array and maintaining a running sum.
   - After processing all subarrays, add all possible sums involving x to the set.
   - Finally, sort the set and print the results.

5. **Debugging Steps**:
   - Print the value of x to verify it's being correctly identified.
   - Print the sums set before and after adding x's possible sums to see the differences.
   - Verify that the empty subarray case is being handled correctly.

The key issue is that the code doesn't properly account for all possible subarray sums, especially those involving the special element x. Focus on these aspects to fix the solution.

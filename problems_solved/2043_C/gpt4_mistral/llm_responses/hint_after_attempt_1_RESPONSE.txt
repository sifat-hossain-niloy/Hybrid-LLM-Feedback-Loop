Verdict: Wrong answer on test 1

======================================================================

Let's analyze the failure and identify the issues:

1. **Root Cause Analysis**:
   - The main issue is that the code doesn't properly handle the empty subarray case (sum = 0).
   - The code also doesn't account for all possible sums that can be formed by adding the special element x to existing subarray sums.
   - The range for x's possible sums (x-1 to x+1) is incorrect and doesn't cover all possible cases.

2. **Specific Hints**:
   - **Empty Subarray**: Remember that the empty subarray should always be considered, with sum 0.
   - **Special Element Handling**: When you find the special element x, you need to consider all possible sums that can be formed by adding x to any existing subarray sum.
   - **Range for x**: The range for x's possible sums should be from x to x multiplied by the length of the array, not just x-1 to x+1.
   - **Initial Sum**: Start with sum = 0 to account for the empty subarray.
   - **Sorting and Deduplication**: After collecting all possible sums, sort them and remove duplicates before printing.

3. **Edge Cases to Consider**:
   - Arrays with only one element (the special element x).
   - Arrays where all elements are -1 or 1.
   - Arrays with multiple special elements (though the problem states at most one).

4. **Algorithmic Improvements**:
   - Use a set to store sums to automatically handle deduplication.
   - After processing all subarrays, add all possible sums involving x to the set.
   - Finally, sort the set and print the results.

5. **Debugging Steps**:
   - Print the value of x to verify it's being correctly identified.
   - Print the sums set before and after adding x's possible sums to see the differences.
   - Verify that the empty subarray case is being handled correctly.

The key issue is that the code doesn't properly account for the empty subarray and doesn't consider all possible sums involving the special element x. Focus on these aspects to fix the solution.

You are a competitive programming expert.

**Problem: 2071_D1**

This is the easy version of the problem. The difference between the versions is that in this version, l=r. You can hack only if you solved all versions of this problem. You are given a positive integer n and the first n terms of an infinite binary sequence a, which is defined as follows: For m>n, a_m = a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus ... \oplus a_{\lfloor \frac{m}{2} \rfloor}^{\text{∗}}. Your task is to compute the sum of elements in a given range [l, r]: a_l + a_{l + 1} + ... + a_r.^{\text{∗}}\oplus denotes the bitwise XOR operation.

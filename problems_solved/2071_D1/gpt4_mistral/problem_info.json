  "statement": "This is the easy version of the problem. The difference between the versions is that in this version, l=r. You can hack only if you solved all versions of this problem. You are given a positive integer n and the first n terms of an infinite binary sequence a, which is defined as follows: For m>n, a_m = a_1 \\oplus a_2 \\oplus ... \\oplus a_{\\lfloor \\frac{m}{2} \\rfloor}^{\\text{\u2217}}. Your task is to compute the sum of elements in a given range [l, r]: a_l + a_{l + 1} + ... + a_r.^{\\text{\u2217}}\\oplus deno",

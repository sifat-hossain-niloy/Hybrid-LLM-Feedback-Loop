**Problem: 2043_D**

Given three integers l, r, and G, find two integers A and B (l ≤ A ≤ B ≤ r) such that their greatest common divisor (GCD) equals G and the distance |A - B| is maximized.If there are multiple such pairs, choose the one where A is minimized. If no such pairs exist, output "-1 -1".

**Task:** Please provide a well-structured and optimized C++ solution.

**Problem: 2091_F**

The visitors of the IT Campus "NEIMARK" are not only strong programmers but also physically robust individuals! Some practice swimming, some rowing, and some rock climbing!Master Igor is a prominent figure in the local rock climbing community. One day, he went on a mountain hike to ascend one of the peaks. As an experienced climber, Igor decided not to follow the established trails but to use his skills to climb strictly vertically.Igor found a rectangular vertical section of the mountain and mentally divided it into n horizontal levels. He then split each level into m segments using vertical partitions. Upon inspecting these segments, Igor discovered convenient protrusions that can be grasped (hereafter referred to as holds). Thus, the selected part of the mountain can be represented as an n × m rectangle, with some cells containing holds.Being an experienced programmer, Igor decided to count the number of valid routes. A route is defined as a sequence of distinct holds. A route is co

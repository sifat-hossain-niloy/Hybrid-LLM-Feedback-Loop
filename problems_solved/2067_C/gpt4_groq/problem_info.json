In one operation, you can add to n any positive integer whose decimal representation contains only the digit 9, possibly repeated several times.What is the minimum number of operations needed to make the number n contain at least one digit 7 in its decimal representation?For example, if n = 80, it is sufficient to perform one operation: you can add 99 to n, after the operation n = 179, which contains the digit 7.",

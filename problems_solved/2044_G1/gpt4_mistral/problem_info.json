  "statement": "This is the easy version of the problem. The key difference between the two versions is highlighted in bold.A group of n spiders has come together to exchange plushies. Initially, each spider has 1 plushie. Every year, if spider i has at least one plushie, he will give exactly one plushie to spider r_i. Otherwise, he will do nothing. Note that all plushie transfers happen at the same time. In this version, if any spider has more than 1 plushie at any point in time, they will throw all but 1 away",

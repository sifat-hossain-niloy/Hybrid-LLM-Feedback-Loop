  "statement": "This is the easy version of the problem. The difference between the versions is that in this version, n \u2264 300. You can hack only if you solved all versions of this problem. A sequence b_1, b_2, ..., b_k is called good if there exists a coloring of each index i in red or blue such that for every pair of indices i < j with b_i > b_j, the colors assigned to i and j are different.You are given a sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. Compute the number of good subsequences of the sequence, including the empty",

**Problem: 2106_E**

Wolf has found n sheep with tastiness values p_1, p_2, ..., p_n where p is a permutation^{\text{∗}}. Wolf wants to perform binary search on p to find the sheep with tastiness of k, but p may not necessarily be sorted. The success of binary search on the range [l, r] for k is represented as f(l, r, k), which is defined as follows:If l > r, then f(l, r, k) fails. Otherwise, let m = \lfloor\frac{l + r}{2}\rfloor, and: If p_m = k, then f(l, r, k) is successful, If p_m < k, then f(l, r, k) = f(m+1, r, k), If p_m > k, then f(l, r, k) = f(l, m-1, k). Cow the Nerd decides to help Wolf out. Cow the Nerd is given q queries, each consisting of three integers l, r, and k. Before the search begins, Cow the Nerd may choose a non-negative integer d, and d indices 1 ≤ i_1 < i_2 < ... < i_d ≤ n where p_{i_j} ≠q k over all 1 ≤q j ≤q d. Then, he may re-order the elements p_{i_1}, p_{i_2}, ..., p_{i_d} however he likes.For each query, output the minimum integer d that Cow the Nerd must choose so that f(l,

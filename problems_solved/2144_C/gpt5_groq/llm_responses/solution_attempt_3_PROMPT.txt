You are a competitive programming expert.

**Problem: 2144_C**

You are given two integer arrays a and b both of length n.You can choose any subset of indices and swap the elements at those positions (i. e. make a swap(a_i, b_i) for each i in the subset). A subset of indices is considered good if, after the swapping, both arrays are sorted in non-descending order.Your task is to calculate the number of good subsets. Since the answer can be large, print it modulo 998244353.

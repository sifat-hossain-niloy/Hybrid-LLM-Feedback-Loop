**Problem: 2120_D**

Aryan and Harshith play a game. They both start with three integers a, b, and k. Aryan then gives Harshith two integers n and m. Harshith then gives Aryan a matrix X with n rows and m columns, such that each of the elements of X is between 1 and k(inclusive). After that, Aryan wins if he can find a submatrix^{\text{∗}} Y of X with a rows and b columns such that all elements of Y are equal.For example, when a=2, b=2, k=6, n=3 and m=3, if Harshith gives Aryan the matrix below, it is a win for Aryan as it has a submatrix of size 2× 2 with all elements equal to 1 as shown below. Example of a matrix where Aryan wins Aryan gives you the values of a, b, and k. He asks you to find the lexicographically minimum tuple (n,m) that he should give to Harshith such that Aryan always wins. Help Aryan win the game. Assume that Harshith plays optimally. The values of n and m can be large, so output them modulo 10^9+7. A tuple (n_1, m_1) is said to be lexicographically smaller than (n_2, m_2) if either n

**Task:** Please provide a well-structured and optimized C++ solution.

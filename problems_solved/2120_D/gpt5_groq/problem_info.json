  "statement": "Aryan and Harshith play a game. They both start with three integers a, b, and k. Aryan then gives Harshith two integers n and m. Harshith then gives Aryan a matrix X with n rows and m columns, such that each of the elements of X is between 1 and k(inclusive). After that, Aryan wins if he can find a submatrix^{\\text{\u2217}} Y of X with a rows and b columns such that all elements of Y are equal.For example, when a=2, b=2, k=6, n=3 and m=3, if Harshith gives Aryan the matrix below, it is a win for Arya",

  "statement": "Yousef has an array a of size n. He wants to partition the array into one or more contiguous segments such that each element a_i belongs to exactly one segment.A partition is called cool if, for every segment b_j, all elements in b_j also appear in b_{j + 1} (if it exists). That is, every element in a segment must also be present in the segment following it.For example, if a = [1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 5], a cool partition Yousef can make is b_1 = [1, 2], b_2 = [2, 3, 1, 5]. This is a cool partition becau",

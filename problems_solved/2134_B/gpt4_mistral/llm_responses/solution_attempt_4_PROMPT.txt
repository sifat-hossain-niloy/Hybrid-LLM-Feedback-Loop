You are a competitive programming expert.

**Problem: 2134_B**

You are given an array of n positive integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n and a positive integer k.In one operation, you may add either 0 or k to each a_i, i.e., choose another array of n integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_n where each b_i is either 0 or k, and update a_i to a_i + b_i for 1 ≤ i ≤ n. Note that you can choose different values for each element of the array b.Your task is to perform at most k such operations to make \gcd(a_1, a_2, ..., a_n) > 1 ^{\text{∗}}. It can be proved that this is always possible.Output the final array after the operations. You do not have to output the operations themselves.^{\text{∗}}\gcd(a_1, a_2, ..., a_n) denotes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a_1, a_2, ..., a_n.

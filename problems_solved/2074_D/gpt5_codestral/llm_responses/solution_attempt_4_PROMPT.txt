**Problem: 2074_D**

The pink soldiers drew n circles with their center on the x-axis of the plane. Also, they have told that the sum of radii is exactly m^{\text{∗}}.Please find the number of integer points inside or on the border of at least one circle. Formally, the problem is defined as follows.You are given an integer sequence x_1,x_2,...,x_n and a positive integer sequence r_1,r_2,...,r_n, where it is known that ∑_{i=1}^n r_i = m.You must count the number of integer pairs (x,y) that satisfy the following condition. There exists an index i such that (x-x_i)^2 + y^2 ≤ r_i^2 (1 ≤ i ≤ n). ^{\text{∗}}Is this information really useful? Don't ask me; I don't really know.

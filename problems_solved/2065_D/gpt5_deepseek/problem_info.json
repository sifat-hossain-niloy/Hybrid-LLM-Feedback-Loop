  "statement": "Let's denote the score of an array b with k elements as \u2211_{i=1}^{k}\u2264ft(\u2211_{j=1}^ib_j\\right). In other words, let S_i denote the sum of the first i elements of b. Then, the score can be denoted as S_1+S_2+...+S_k.Skibidus is given n arrays a_1,a_2,...,a_n, each of which contains m elements. Being the sigma that he is, he would like to concatenate them in any order to form a single array containing n\u00b7 m elements. Please find the maximum possible score Skibidus can achieve with his concatenated arra",

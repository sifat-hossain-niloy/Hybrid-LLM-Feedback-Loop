**Problem: 2065_D**

Let's denote the score of an array b with k elements as ∑_{i=1}^{k}≤ft(∑_{j=1}^ib_j\right). In other words, let S_i denote the sum of the first i elements of b. Then, the score can be denoted as S_1+S_2+...+S_k.Skibidus is given n arrays a_1,a_2,...,a_n, each of which contains m elements. Being the sigma that he is, he would like to concatenate them in any order to form a single array containing n· m elements. Please find the maximum possible score Skibidus can achieve with his concatenated array! Formally, among all possible permutations^{\text{∗}} p of length n, output the maximum score of a_{p_1} + a_{p_2} + ... + a_{p_n}, where + represents concatenation^{\text{†}}.^{\text{∗}}A permutation of length n contains all integers from 1 to n exactly once.^{\text{†}}The concatenation of two arrays c and d with lengths e and f respectively (i.e. c + d) is c_1, c_2, ..., c_e, d_1, d_2, ... d_f.

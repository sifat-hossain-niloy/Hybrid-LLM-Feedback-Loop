You are a competitive programming expert.

**Problem: 2129_B**

You are given a permutation p_1, p_2, ..., p_n of length n.You have to build an array a_1, a_2, ..., a_n in the following way: for each 1 ≤q i ≤q n, set either a_i = p_i or a_i = 2n - p_i. Find the minimum possible number of inversions in the array a_1, a_2, ..., a_n.A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array). An inversion in the array a_1, a_2, ..., a_n is a pair of indices (i, j) such that 1 ≤q i<j ≤q n and a_i>a_j.

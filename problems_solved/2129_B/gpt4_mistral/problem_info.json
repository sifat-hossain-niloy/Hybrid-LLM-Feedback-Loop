  "statement": "You are given a permutation p_1, p_2, ..., p_n of length n.You have to build an array a_1, a_2, ..., a_n in the following way: for each 1 \u2264q i \u2264q n, set either a_i = p_i or a_i = 2n - p_i. Find the minimum possible number of inversions in the array a_1, a_2, ..., a_n.A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is also ",

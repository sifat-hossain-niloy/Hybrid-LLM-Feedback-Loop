  "statement": "For an array b=[b_1,b_2,...,b_m] of length m (b_i \u2265q 2), consider the following two-player game played by Poby and Rekkles. The players take turns, with Poby moving first. On Poby's turn, he must choose an element x \u2265 2 and replace it with \u2264ft\\lfloor \\frac{x}{2} \\right\\rfloor. In other words, he picks i (1 \u2264q i \u2264q m) such that b_i \u2265 2, then does b_i := \u2264ft\\lfloor \\frac{b_i}{2} \\right\\rfloor. On Rekkles' turn, he must choose an element x \u2265 2 from the array b and replace it with x+1. In other word",

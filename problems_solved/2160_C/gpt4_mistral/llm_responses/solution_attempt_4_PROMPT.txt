**Problem: 2160_C**

Given a positive integer x, let f(x) be the positive integer formed by reversing the binary representation of x without leading zeroes. For example, if x=12=1100_2, then f(x)=0011_2=3. You are given an integer n. Please determine if there exists a positive integer x such that x \oplus f(x) = n^{\text{∗}}.^{\text{∗}}Here, \oplus denotes the bitwise XOR operation.

    "statement": "You are given an array of integers a of length n. You can perform the following operation zero or more times: In one operation choose an index i (1 ≤ i ≤ n), assign a_i := a_i + 1, and then move a_i to the back of the array (to the rightmost position). For example, if a = [3, 5, 1, 9], and you choose i = 2, the array becomes [3, 1, 9, 6]. Find the lexicographically smallest^{\\text{∗}} array you can get by performing these operations.^{\\text{∗}}An array c is lexicographically smaller than an array d if and only if one of the following holds: c is a prefix of d, but c ≠ d; or in the first position where c and d differ, the array c has a smaller element than the corresponding element in d.",
    "input_specification": "InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). The description of the test cases follows. The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), the length of the array.The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), the elements of the array.It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.",

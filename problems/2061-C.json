    "statement": "Kevin enjoys logic puzzles.He played a game with n classmates who stand in a line. The i-th person from the left says that there are a_i liars to their left (not including themselves).Each classmate is either honest or a liar, with the restriction that no two liars can stand next to each other. Honest classmates always say the truth. Liars can say either the truth or lies, meaning their statements are considered unreliable.Kevin wants to determine the number of distinct possible game configurations modulo 998\\,244\\,353. Two configurations are considered different if at least one classmate is honest in one configuration and a liar in the other.",
    "input_specification": "InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1≤q n ≤q 2 · 10^5) — the number of classmates.The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0≤q a_i ≤q n) — the number of liars to the left of the i-th person they claimed.It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.",

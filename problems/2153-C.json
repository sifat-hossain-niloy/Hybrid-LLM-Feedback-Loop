    "statement": "You are given n sticks, where the i-th stick has a length of a_i. You want to choose a non-empty subset of these sticks and use them as the sides of a polygon. Each selected stick must be used entirely as a single side of the polygon. It is not allowed for two or more sticks to be joined end-to-end in parallel to form a longer side.Your goal is to form a polygon that is symmetrical, strictly convex, and non-degenerate: Symmetrical: there exists a line of symmetry such that when the polygon is folded along this line, the two halves coincide exactly. Strictly convex: all its internal angles are strictly less than 180^\\circ. Non-degenerate: no two consecutive sides coincide at least partially, no side has zero length, and no angle equals 180^\\circ. Among all such polygons that you can form with the sticks, find the maximum possible perimeter^{\\text{∗}}. If no valid polygon exists, output 0.^{\\text{∗}}The perimeter of a polygon is equal to the sum of the lengths of its sides.",
    "input_specification": "InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3≤ n≤ 2· 10^5) — the number of sticks.The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1≤ a_i≤ 10^9) — the lengths of the sticks.It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2· 10^5.",
    "output_specification": "OutputFor each test case, output a single integer representing the maximum possible perimeter of a non-degenerate, symmetrical and strictly convex polygon that you can form from a non-empty subset of the sticks. If it is not possible, output 0.",

    "note": "In the first test case, you can form an isosceles triangle using all three sticks. It is symmetrical along the vertical dotted line (see left diagram). The perimeter is equal to the sum of the lengths of its sides:\n5+5+7=17\n.\nIn the second test case, the triangle formed by all three sticks is not symmetrical (see right diagram). It can be proven that no symmetrical, non-degenerate convex polygon can be formed from any non-empty subset of the sticks.\nIn the third test case, it is not possible to form a non-degenerate polygon. If all three sides are used, the two sides of length\n5\ncoincide with the side of length\n10\n, producing only a straight line with zero area.\nIn the fourth test case, we can form a symmetrical convex polygon using three sticks of length\n3\n, two sticks of length\n5\n, and one stick of length\n4\n(see left diagram). The last stick of length\n1\ncannot be included, as the resulting polygon would no longer be symmetrical (see right diagram).\nIn the fifth test case, it is not allowed to join the sticks of length\n2\nand\n3\nto form a stick of length\n5\n(which would yield the first test case). It can be proven that no symmetrical, non-degenerate convex polygon can be formed from any non-empty subset of the sticks.",

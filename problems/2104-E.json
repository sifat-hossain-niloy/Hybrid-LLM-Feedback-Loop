    "statement": "Let's call a letter allowed if it is a lowercase letter and is one of the first k letters of the Latin alphabet.You are given a string s of length n, consisting only of allowed letters.Let's call a string t pleasant if t is a subsequence of s.You are given q strings t_1, t_2, ..., t_q. All of them consist only of allowed letters. For each string t_i, calculate the minimum number of allowed letters you need to append to it on the right so that it stops being pleasant.A sequence t is a subsequence of a sequence s if t can be obtained from s by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) element from arbitrary positions.",
    "input_specification": "InputThe first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6; 1 ≤ k ≤ 26) — the length of the string s and the number of allowed letters.The second line contains the string s, consisting of n lowercase Latin letters. Each character of the string is one of the first k letters of the Latin alphabet.The third line contains one integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5) — the number of queries.The next q lines contain queries: one query per line. The i-th line contains the string t_i, consisting only of allowed letters.Additional constraint on input: the total length of all t_i does not exceed 10^6.",
    "output_specification": "OutputFor each query, output one integer — the minimum number of allowed letters that need to be appended to the string on the right so that it stops being pleasant.",

    "statement": "Harshith attained enlightenment in Competitive Programming by training under a Divine Tree. A divine tree is a rooted tree^{\\text{∗}} with n nodes, labelled from 1 to n. The divineness of a node v, denoted d(v), is defined as the smallest node label on the unique simple path from the root to node v.Aryan, being a hungry Competitive Programmer, asked Harshith to pass on the knowledge. Harshith agreed on the condition that Aryan would be given two positive integers n and m, and he had to construct a divine tree with n nodes such that the total divineness of the tree is m, i.e., \\displaystyle∑\\limits_{i=1}^n d(i)=m. If no such tree exists, Aryan must report that it is impossible.Desperate for knowledge, Aryan turned to you for help in completing this task. As a good friend of his, help him solve the task.^{\\text{∗}}A tree is a connected graph without cycles. A rooted tree is a tree where one vertex is special and called the root.",
    "input_specification": "InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^{12}).It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.",
    "output_specification": "OutputFor each test case, output a single integer k in one line — the root of the tree.Then n-1 lines follow, each containing a description of an edge of the tree — a pair of positive integers u_i,v_i (1≤ u_i,v_i≤ n, u_i≠ v_i), denoting the i-th edge connects vertices u_i and v_i.The edges and vertices of the edges can be printed in any order. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.If there is no solution, print \"-1\" instead.",

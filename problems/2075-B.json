    "statement": "You are given an integer array a of size n. Initially, all elements of the array are colored red.You have to choose exactly k elements of the array and paint them blue. Then, while there is at least one red element, you have to select any red element with a blue neighbor and make it blue.The cost of painting the array is defined as the sum of the first k chosen elements and the last painted element. Your task is to calculate the maximum possible cost of painting for the given array.",

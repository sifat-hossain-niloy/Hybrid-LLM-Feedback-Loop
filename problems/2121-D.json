    "statement": "You are given two arrays of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n and b_1, b_2, ..., b_n. It is guaranteed that each integer from 1 to 2 · n appears in exactly one of the arrays.You need to perform a certain number of operations (possibly zero) so that both of the following conditions are satisfied: For each 1 ≤q i < n, it holds that a_i < a_{i + 1} and b_i < b_{i + 1}. For each 1 ≤q i ≤q n, it holds that a_i < b_i. During each operation, you can perform exactly one of the following three actions: Choose an index 1 ≤q i < n and swap the values a_i and a_{i + 1}. Choose an index 1 ≤q i < n and swap the values b_i and b_{i + 1}. Choose an index 1 ≤q i ≤q n and swap the values a_i and b_i.You do not need to minimize the number of operations, but the total number must not exceed 1709. Find any sequence of operations that satisfies both conditions.",
    "input_specification": "InputEach test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤q t ≤q 100) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 ≤q n ≤q 40) — the length of the arrays a and b.The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤q a_i ≤q 2 · n).The third line of each test case contains n integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_n (1 ≤q b_i ≤q 2 · n).It is guaranteed that each integer from 1 to 2 · n appears either in array a or in array b.",
    "output_specification": "OutputFor each test case, output the sequence of operations. In the first line for each test case, output the number of operations k. Note that 0 ≤q k ≤q 1709. In the following k lines for each test case, output the operations themselves: If you want to swap the values a_i and a_{i + 1}, output two integers 1 and i. Note that 1 ≤q i < n. If you want to swap the values b_i and b_{i + 1}, output two integers 2 and i. Note that 1 ≤q i < n. If you want to swap the values a_i and b_i, output two integers 3 and i. Note that 1 ≤q i ≤q n.It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.",

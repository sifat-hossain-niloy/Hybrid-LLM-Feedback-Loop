    "statement": "You're given an array a of length n. For each index i such that 1 ≤ i < n, you can perform the following operation at most once: Assign a_i := a_i \\oplus a_{i+1}, where \\oplus denotes the bitwise XOR operation. . You can choose indices and perform the operations in any sequential order.Given another array b of length n, determine if it is possible to transform a to b.",
    "input_specification": "InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5).The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i < 2^{30}).The third line of each test case contains n integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_n (0 ≤ b_i < 2^{30}).It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.",
    "output_specification": "OutputFor each test case, output \"YES\" (quotes excluded) if a can be transformed to b; otherwise, output \"NO\". You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings \"yEs\", \"yes\", \"Yes\", and \"YES\" will be recognized as positive responses.",

    "statement": "You are given n^2 cards with values from 0 to n^2-1. You are to arrange them in a n by n grid such that there is exactly one card in each cell.The MEX (minimum excluded value) of a subgrid^{\\text{∗}} is defined as the smallest non-negative integer that does not appear in the subgrid.Your task is to arrange the cards such that the sum of MEX values over all ≤ft(\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\\right)^2 subgrids is maximized.^{\\text{∗}}A subgrid of a n by n grid is specified by four numbers l_1, r_1, l_2, r_2 satisfying 1≤ l_1≤ r_1≤ n and 1≤ l_2≤ r_2≤ n. The element in the i-th row and the j-th column of the grid is part of the subgrid if and only if l_1≤ i≤ r_1 and l_2≤ j≤ r_2.",
    "input_specification": "InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1≤ n≤ 500) — the side length of the grid.It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 1000.",
    "output_specification": "OutputFor each test case, output n lines, each containing n integers representing the elements of the grid. If there are multiple answers, you can output any of them.",

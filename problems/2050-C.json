    "statement": "You are given a number n with a length of no more than 10^5.You can perform the following operation any number of times: choose one of its digits, square it, and replace the original digit with the result. The result must be a digit (that is, if you choose the digit x, then the value of x^2 must be less than 10).Is it possible to obtain a number that is divisible by 9 through these operations?",
    "input_specification": "InputThe first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases.The only line of each test case contains the number n, without leading zeros. The length of the number does not exceed 10^5.It is guaranteed that the sum of the lengths of the numbers across all test cases does not exceed 10^5.",
    "output_specification": "OutputFor each test case, output \"YES\" if it is possible to obtain a number divisible by 9 using the described operations, and \"NO\" otherwise.You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example, the strings \"yEs\", \"yes\", \"Yes\", and \"YES\" will be accepted as a positive answer.",

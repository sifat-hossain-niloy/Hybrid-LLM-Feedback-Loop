    "statement": "You are given a number\n𝑛\nwith a length of no more than\n10\n5\n.\nYou can perform the following operation any number of times: choose one of its digits, square it, and replace the original digit with the result. The result must be a digit (that is, if you choose the digit\n𝑥\n, then the value of\n𝑥\n2\nmust be less than\n10\n).\nIs it possible to obtain a number that is divisible by\n9\nthrough these operations?",

The length of the number does not exceed\n10\n5\n.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of the lengths of the numbers across all test cases does not exceed\n10\n5\n.",
    "output_specification": "For each test case, output \"YES\" if it is possible to obtain a number divisible by\n9\nusing the described operations, and \"NO\" otherwise.\nYou can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example, the strings \"yEs\", \"yes\", \"Yes\", and \"YES\" will be accepted as a positive answer.",

    "statement": "There are no mountains in Florida, and Florida Man cannot comprehend their existence. As such, he really needs your help with this one.In the wilderness lies a region of mountainous terrain represented as a rectangular grid with n rows and m columns. Each cell in the grid is identified by its position (i, j), where i is the row index and j is the column index. The altitude of cell (i, j) is denoted by a_{i,j}.However, this region has been tampered with. A path consisting of n + m - 1 cells, starting from the top-left corner (1, 1) and ending at the bottom-right corner (n, m), has been cleared. For every cell (i, j) along this path, the altitude a_{i,j} has been set to 0. The path moves strictly via downward (\\mathtt{D}) or rightward (\\mathtt{R}) steps.To restore the terrain to its original state, it is known that the region possessed a magical property before it was tampered with: all rows and all columns shared the same sum of altitudes. More formally, there exists an integer x such that ∑_{j=1}^m a_{i, j} = x for all 1≤ i≤ n, and ∑_{i=1}^n a_{i, j} = x for all 1≤ j≤ m.Your task is to assign new altitudes to the cells on the path such that the above magical property is restored. It can be proven that a solution always exists. If there are multiple solutions that satisfy the property, any one of them may be provided.",
    "input_specification": "InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (2 ≤q n, m ≤q 1000) — the number of rows and columns in the grid.The second line of each test case contains a string s of length n+m-2 (s_i = \\mathtt{D} or s_i = \\mathtt{R}) — the steps the path makes from (1, 1) to (n, m). The character \\mathtt{D} represents a downward step, and \\mathtt{R} represents a rightward step.The i-th of the next n lines each contain m integers a_{i,1}, a_{i, 2}, ..., a_{i,m} (-10^6 ≤q a_{i,j} ≤q 10^6) — the altitude of each cell in the grid. It is guaranteed that if a cell (i, j) lies on the path, then a_{i,j} = 0.It is guaranteed that the sum of n · m over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.",
    "output_specification": "OutputFor each test case, output n lines of m integers representing the restored grid of altitudes b_{i, j}. The altitudes must satisfy -10^{15} ≤q b_{i,j} ≤q 10^{15}, and additionally a_{i,j} = b_{i,j} if (i, j) is not on the path. If multiple solutions exist, output any of them.",

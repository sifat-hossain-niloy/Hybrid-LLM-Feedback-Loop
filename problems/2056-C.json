In other words,\n𝑔(𝑎)\ncounts the number of palindromic subsequences in\n𝑎\nthat have the maximum length.\nGiven an integer\n𝑛\n, your task is to find any sequence\n𝑎\nof\n𝑛\nintegers that satisfies the following conditions:\n1≤\n𝑎\n𝑖\n≤𝑛\nfor all\n1≤𝑖≤𝑛\n.\n𝑔(𝑎)>𝑛\nIt can be proven that such a sequence always exists under the given constraints.\n∗\nA sequence\n𝑥\nis a subsequence of a sequence\n𝑦\nif\n𝑥\ncan be obtained from\n𝑦\nby the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) element from arbitrary positions.\n†\nA palindrome is a sequence that reads the same from left to right as from right to left. For example,\n[1,2,1,3,1,2,1]\n,\n[5,5,5,5]\n, and\n[4,3,3,4]\nare palindromes, while\n[1,2]\nand\n[2,3,3,3,3]\nare not.",

    "note": "In the first example, one possible solution is\n𝑎=[1,1,2,3,1,2]\n. In this case,\n𝑓(𝑎)=3\nas the longest palindromic subsequence has length\n3\n.

    "statement": "For an integer sequence a = [a_1, a_2, ..., a_n], we define f(a) as the length of the longest subsequence^{\\text{∗}} of a that is a palindrome^{\\text{†}}. Let g(a) represent the number of subsequences of length f(a) that are palindromes. In other words, g(a) counts the number of palindromic subsequences in a that have the maximum length.Given an integer n, your task is to find any sequence a of n integers that satisfies the following conditions: 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n. g(a) > n It can be proven that such a sequence always exists under the given constraints.^{\\text{∗}}A sequence x is a subsequence of a sequence y if x can be obtained from y by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) element from arbitrary positions. ^{\\text{†}}A palindrome is a sequence that reads the same from left to right as from right to left. For example, [1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1], [5, 5, 5, 5], and [4, 3, 3, 4] are palindromes, while [1, 2] and [2, 3, 3, 3, 3] are not.",
    "input_specification": "InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (\\color{red}{6} ≤ n ≤ 100) — the length of the sequence.Note that there are no constraints on the sum of n over all test cases.",
    "output_specification": "OutputFor each test case, output n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, representing an array that satisfies the conditions.If there are multiple solutions, you may output any of them.",

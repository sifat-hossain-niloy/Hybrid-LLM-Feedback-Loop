    "statement": "Breach of Faith - Supire feat.eili You and your team have worked tirelessly until you have a sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n+1} of positive integers satisfying these properties. 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^{18} for all 1 ≤ i ≤ 2n + 1. a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n+1} are pairwise distinct. a_1 = a_2 - a_3 + a_4 - a_5 + ... + a_{2n} - a_{2n+1}. However, the people you worked with sabotaged you because they wanted to publish this sequence first. They deleted one number from this sequence and shuffled the rest, leaving you with a sequence b_1, b_2, ..., b_{2n}. You have forgotten the sequence a and want to find a way to recover it.If there are many possible sequences, you can output any of them. It can be proven under the constraints of the problem that at least one sequence a exists.",
    "input_specification": "InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains one integer n (1 ≤q n ≤q 2 · 10^5).The second line of each test case contains 2n distinct integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_{2n} (1 ≤q b_i ≤q 10^9), denoting the sequence b.It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.",
    "output_specification": "OutputFor each test case, output 2n+1 distinct integers, denoting the sequence a (1 ≤q a_i ≤q 10^{18}). If there are multiple possible sequences, you can output any of them. The sequence a should satisfy the given conditions, and it should be possible to obtain b after deleting one element from a and shuffling the remaining elements.",

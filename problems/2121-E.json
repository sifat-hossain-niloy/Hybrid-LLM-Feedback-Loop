    "statement": "For two integers a and b, we define f(a, b) as the number of positions in the decimal representation of the numbers a and b where their digits are the same. For example, f(12, 21) = 0, f(31, 37) = 1, f(19891, 18981) = 2, f(54321, 24361) = 3.You are given two integers l and r of the same length in decimal representation. Consider all integers l ≤q x ≤q r. Your task is to find the minimum value of f(l, x) + f(x, r).",
    "input_specification": "InputEach test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤q t ≤q 10^4) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers l and r (1 ≤q l ≤q r < 10^9).It is guaranteed that the numbers l and r have the same length in decimal representation and do not have leading zeros.",

    "statement": "You are given an array a of n integers, where all elements except for at most one are equal to -1 or 1. The remaining element x satisfies -10^9 ≤ x ≤ 10^9.Find all possible sums of subarrays of a, including the empty subarray, whose sum is defined as 0. In other words, find all integers x such that the array a has at least one subarray (possibly empty) with sum equal to x. A subarray is a contiguous subsegment of an array.Output these sums in ascending order. Each sum should be printed only once, even if it is achieved by multiple subarrays.",
    "input_specification": "InputThe first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases. Then, t test cases follow.Each test case consists of two lines: The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) — the size of the array. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (-10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) — the elements of the array a. In the array a, there is at most one element that is neither 1 nor -1. Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.",

    "statement": "You are given an array of n positive integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n and a positive integer k.In one operation, you may add either 0 or k to each a_i, i.e., choose another array of n integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_n where each b_i is either 0 or k, and update a_i to a_i + b_i for 1 ≤ i ≤ n. Note that you can choose different values for each element of the array b.Your task is to perform at most k such operations to make \\gcd(a_1, a_2, ..., a_n) > 1 ^{\\text{∗}}. It can be proved that this is always possible.Output the final array after the operations. You do not have to output the operations themselves.^{\\text{∗}}\\gcd(a_1, a_2, ..., a_n) denotes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a_1, a_2, ..., a_n.",
    "input_specification": "InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤q k ≤q 10^9) — the length of the array a and the given constant.The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,...,a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) — the elements of the array a.It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.",
    "output_specification": "OutputFor each test case, output an array of n integers in a new line — the final array after the operations. The integers in the output should be within the range from 1 to 10^9 + k^2.If there are multiple valid outputs, you can output any of them.Note that you do not have to minimize the number of operations.",

    "statement": "You are given a permutation a and b of length n^{\\text{∗}}. You can perform the following operation at most n times: Choose two indices i and j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n, i ≠ j), swap a_i with a_j, swap b_i with b_j. Determine whether a and b can be reverses of each other after operations. In other words, for each i = 1, 2, ..., n, a_i = b_{n + 1 - i}.If it is possible, output any valid sequence of operations. Otherwise, output -1.^{\\text{∗}}A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).",
    "input_specification": "InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) — the length of the permutations.The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n).The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_n (1 ≤ b_i ≤ n).It is guaranteed that a and b are permutations of length n.It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2· 10^5.",
    "output_specification": "OutputFor each test case, if it is impossible, output -1 in the only line. Otherwise, output a single integer m (0 ≤ m ≤ n) — the number of operations in the first line. In the following m lines, output two integers — the indices i and j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n, i ≠ j) in each operation in order. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.",

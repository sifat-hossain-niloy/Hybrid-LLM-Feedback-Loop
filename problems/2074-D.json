    "statement": "The pink soldiers drew n circles with their center on the x-axis of the plane. Also, they have told that the sum of radii is exactly m^{\\text{∗}}.Please find the number of integer points inside or on the border of at least one circle. Formally, the problem is defined as follows.You are given an integer sequence x_1,x_2,...,x_n and a positive integer sequence r_1,r_2,...,r_n, where it is known that ∑_{i=1}^n r_i = m.You must count the number of integer pairs (x,y) that satisfy the following condition. There exists an index i such that (x-x_i)^2 + y^2 ≤ r_i^2 (1 ≤ i ≤ n). ^{\\text{∗}}Is this information really useful? Don't ask me; I don't really know.",
    "input_specification": "InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2· 10^5).The second line of each test case contains x_1,x_2,...,x_n — the centers of the circles (-10^9 ≤ x_i ≤ 10^9).The third line of each test case contains r_1,r_2,...,r_n — the radii of the circles (1 ≤ r_i, ∑_{i=1}^n r_i = m).It is guaranteed that the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2· 10^5.",
    "output_specification": "OutputFor each test case, output the number of integer points satisfying the condition on a separate line.",

There are\n13\ninteger points such that\n𝑥\n2\n+\n𝑦\n2\n≤\n2\n2\n, so the answer is\n13\n.\nOn the second test case, the circle with\n𝑟\n1\n=1\nis not completely inside the circle with\n𝑟\n2\n=2\n.

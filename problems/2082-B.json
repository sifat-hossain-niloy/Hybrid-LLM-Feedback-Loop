    "statement": "Ecrade has an integer x. There are two kinds of operations. Replace x with ≤ft\\lfloor \\dfrac{x}{2}\\right\\rfloor, where ≤ft\\lfloor \\dfrac{x}{2}\\right\\rfloor is the greatest integer ≤ \\dfrac{x}{2}. Replace x with ≤ft\\lceil \\dfrac{x}{2}\\right\\rceil, where ≤ft\\lceil \\dfrac{x}{2}\\right\\rceil is the smallest integer ≥ \\dfrac{x}{2}. Ecrade will perform exactly n first operations and m second operations in any order. He wants to know the minimum and the maximum possible value of x after n+m operations. However, it seems a little difficult, so please help him!",
    "input_specification": "InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). The description of the test cases follows. The only line of each test case contains three integers x, n, and m (0 ≤ x, n, m ≤ 10^9).",

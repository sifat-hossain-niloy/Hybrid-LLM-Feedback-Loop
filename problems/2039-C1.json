You can only make hacks if both versions of the problem are solved.Shohag has two integers x and m. Help him count the number of integers 1 ≤ y ≤ m such that \\mathbf{x ≠q y} and x \\oplus y is a divisor^{\\text{∗}} of either x, y, or both. Here \\oplus is the bitwise XOR operator.^{\\text{∗}}The number b is a divisor of the number a if there exists an integer c such that a = b · c.",

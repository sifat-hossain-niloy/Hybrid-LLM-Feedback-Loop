    "statement": "If it was so, then let's make it a deal...— MayDay, GentlenessEven after copying the paintings from famous artists for ten years, unfortunately, Eric is still unable to become a skillful impressionist painter. He wants to forget something, but the white bear phenomenon just keeps hanging over him.Eric still remembers n pieces of impressions in the form of an integer array. He records them as w_1, w_2, ..., w_n. However, he has a poor memory of the impressions. For each 1 ≤q i ≤q n, he can only remember that l_i ≤q w_i ≤q r_i.Eric believes that impression i is unique if and only if there exists a possible array w_1, w_2, ..., w_n such that w_i ≠q w_j holds for all 1 ≤q j ≤q n with j ≠q i.Please help Eric determine whether impression i is unique for every 1 ≤q i ≤q n, independently for each i. Perhaps your judgment can help rewrite the final story.",
    "input_specification": "InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 ≤q t ≤q 10^4) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 ≤q n ≤q 2· 10^5) — the number of impressions.Then n lines follow, the i-th containing two integers l_i and r_i (1 ≤q l_i ≤q r_i ≤q 2· n) — the minimum possible value and the maximum possible value of w_i.It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2· 10^5.",

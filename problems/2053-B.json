    "statement": "If it was so, then let's make it a deal...\n— MayDay, Gentleness\nEven after copying the paintings from famous artists for ten years, unfortunately, Eric is still unable to become a skillful impressionist painter. He wants to forget something, but the white bear phenomenon just keeps hanging over him.\nEric still remembers\n𝑛\npieces of impressions in the form of an integer array. He records them as\n𝑤\n1\n,\n𝑤\n2\n,…,\n𝑤\n𝑛\n. However, he has a poor memory of the impressions. For each\n1≤𝑖≤𝑛\n, he can only remember that\n𝑙\n𝑖\n≤\n𝑤\n𝑖\n≤\n𝑟\n𝑖\n.\nEric believes that impression\n𝑖\nis unique if and only if there exists a possible array\n𝑤\n1\n,\n𝑤\n2\n,…,\n𝑤\n𝑛\nsuch that\n𝑤\n𝑖\n≠\n𝑤\n𝑗\nholds for all\n1≤𝑗≤𝑛\nwith\n𝑗≠𝑖\n.\nPlease help Eric determine whether impression\n𝑖\nis unique for every\n1≤𝑖≤𝑛\n, independently for each\n𝑖\n. Perhaps your judgment can help rewrite the final story.",

The description of test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer\n𝑛\n(\n1≤𝑛≤2⋅\n10\n5\n) — the number of impressions.\nThen\n𝑛\nlines follow, the\n𝑖\n-th containing two integers\n𝑙\n𝑖\nand\n𝑟\n𝑖\n(\n1≤\n𝑙\n𝑖\n≤\n𝑟\n𝑖\n≤2⋅𝑛\n) — the minimum possible value and the maximum possible value of\n𝑤\n𝑖\n.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of\n𝑛\nover all test cases does not exceed\n2⋅\n10\n5\n.",

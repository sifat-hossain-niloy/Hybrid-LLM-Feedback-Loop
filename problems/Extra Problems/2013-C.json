He is also ready to answer Dimash's questions of the following type:Dimash says a binary string t, and Mansur replies whether it is true that t is a substring of his password.Help Dimash find out the password in no more than 2n operations; otherwise, Mansur will understand the trick and stop communicating with him.",

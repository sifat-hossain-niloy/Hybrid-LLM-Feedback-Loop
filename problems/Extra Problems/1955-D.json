    "statement": "Maxim has an array a of n integers and an array b of m integers (m ≤ n).Maxim considers an array c of length m to be good if the elements of array c can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of array b. For example, if b = [1, 2, 3, 4] and k = 3, then the arrays [4, 1, 2, 3] and [2, 3, 4, 5] are good (they can be reordered as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4] and [5, 2, 3, 4]), while the arrays [3, 4, 5, 6] and [3, 4, 3, 4] are not good.Maxim wants to choose every subsegment of array a of length m as the elements of array c. Help Maxim count how many selected arrays will be good.In other words, find the number of positions 1 ≤ l ≤ n - m + 1 such that the elements a_l, a_{l+1}, ..., a_{l + m - 1} form a good array.",
    "input_specification": "InputThe first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains three integers n, m, and k (1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) — the number of elements in arrays a and b, the required number of matching elements.The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) — the elements of array a. Elements of the array a are not necessarily unique.The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_m (1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6) — the elements of array b. Elements of the array b are not necessarily unique.It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

    "statement": "Imagine a game where you play as a character that has two attributes: \"Strength\" and \"Intelligence\", that are at zero level initially.During the game, you'll acquire m attribute points that allow you to increase your attribute levels — one point will increase one of the attributes by one level. But sometimes, you'll encounter a so-called \"Attribute Checks\": if your corresponding attribute is high enough, you'll pass it; otherwise, you'll fail it.Spending some time, you finally prepared a list which contains records of all points you got and all checks you've met. And now you're wondering: what is the maximum number of attribute checks you can pass in a single run if you'd spend points wisely?Note that you can't change the order of records.",
    "input_specification": "InputThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ m ≤ 5000; m < n ≤ 2 · 10^6) — the number of records in the list and the total number of points you'll get during the game.The second line contains n integers r_1, r_2, ..., r_n (-m ≤ r_i ≤ m), where r_i encodes the i-th record: If r_i = 0, then the i-th record is an acquiring one attribute point. You can spend to level up either Strength or Intelligence; If r_i > 0, then it's an Intelligence check: if your Intelligence level is greater than or equal to |r_i|, you pass. If r_i < 0, then it's a Strength check: if your Strength level is greater than or equal to |r_i|, you pass. Additional constraint on the input: the sequence r_1, r_2, ..., r_n contains exactly m elements equal to 0.",

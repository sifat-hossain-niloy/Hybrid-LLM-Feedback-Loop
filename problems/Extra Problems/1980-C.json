    "statement": "Sofia had an array of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. One day she got bored with it, so she decided to sequentially apply m modification operations to it.Each modification operation is described by a pair of numbers \\langle c_j, d_j \\rangle and means that the element of the array with index c_j should be assigned the value d_j, i.e., perform the assignment a_{c_j} = d_j. After applying all modification operations sequentially, Sofia discarded the resulting array.Recently, you found an array of n integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_n. You are interested in whether this array is Sofia's array. You know the values of the original array, as well as the values d_1, d_2, ..., d_m. The values c_1, c_2, ..., c_m turned out to be lost.Is there a sequence c_1, c_2, ..., c_m such that the sequential application of modification operations \\langle c_1, d_1, \\rangle, \\langle c_2, d_2, \\rangle, ..., \\langle c_m, d_m \\rangle to the array a_1, a_2, ..., a_n transforms it into the array b_1, b_2, ..., b_n?",
    "input_specification": "InputThe first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases.Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) — the size of the array.The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) — the elements of the original array.The third line of each test case contains n integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_n (1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9) — the elements of the found array.The fourth line contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5) — the number of modification operations.The fifth line contains m integers d_1, d_2, ..., d_m (1 ≤ d_j ≤ 10^9) — the preserved value for each modification operation.It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, similarly the sum of the values of m for all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.",

As an answer, output \"YES\" if there exists a suitable sequence c_1, c_2, ..., c_m, and \"NO\" otherwise.You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings \"yEs\", \"yes\", \"Yes\" and \"YES\" will be recognized as a positive answer).",

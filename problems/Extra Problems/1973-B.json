    "statement": "Today, Cat and Fox found an array a consisting of n non-negative integers. Define the loneliness of a as the smallest positive integer k (1 ≤ k ≤ n) such that for any two positive integers i and j (1 ≤q i, j ≤q n - k +1), the following holds: a_i | a_{i+1} | ... | a_{i+k-1} = a_j | a_{j+1} | ... | a_{j+k-1}, where x | y denotes the bitwise OR of x and y. In other words, for every k consecutive elements, their bitwise OR should be the same. Note that the loneliness of a is well-defined, because for k = n the condition is satisfied.Cat and Fox want to know how lonely the array a is. Help them calculate the loneliness of the found array.",
    "input_specification": "InputEach test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤q t ≤q 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains one integer n (1 ≤q n ≤q 10^5) — the length of the array a.The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤q a_i < 2^{20}) — the elements of the array.It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 10^5.",

We can verify that the condition is not true for any smaller\nk\n, so the answer is indeed\n3\n.",

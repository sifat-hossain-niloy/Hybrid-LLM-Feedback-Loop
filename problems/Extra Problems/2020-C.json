    "statement": "You are given three non-negative integers b, c, and d.Please find a non-negative integer a ∈ [0, 2^{61}] such that (a\\, |\\, b)-(a\\, \\&\\, c)=d, where | and \\& denote the bitwise OR operation and the bitwise AND operation, respectively.If such an a exists, print its value. If there is no solution, print a single integer -1. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.",
    "input_specification": "InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5). The description of the test cases follows.The only line of each test case contains three positive integers b, c, and d (0 ≤ b, c, d ≤ 10^{18}).",
    "output_specification": "OutputFor each test case, output the value of a, or -1 if there is no solution. Please note that a must be non-negative and cannot exceed 2^{61}.",

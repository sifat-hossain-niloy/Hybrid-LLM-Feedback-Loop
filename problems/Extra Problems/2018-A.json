    "statement": "DJ Genki vs Gram - Einherjar Joker⠀You have some cards. An integer between 1 and n is written on each card: specifically, for each i from 1 to n, you have a_i cards which have the number i written on them.There is also a shop which contains unlimited cards of each type. You have k coins, so you can buy at most k new cards in total, and the cards you buy can contain any integer between \\mathbf{1} and \\mathbf{n}, inclusive.After buying the new cards, you must partition all your cards into decks, according to the following rules: all the decks must have the same size; there are no pairs of cards with the same value in the same deck. Find the maximum possible size of a deck after buying cards and partitioning them optimally.",
    "input_specification": "InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains two integers n, k (1 ≤q n ≤q 2 · 10^5, 0 ≤q k ≤q 10^{16}) — the number of distinct types of cards and the number of coins.The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤q a_i ≤q 10^{10}, ∑ a_i ≥q 1) — the number of cards of type i you have at the beginning, for each 1 ≤q i ≤q n.It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.",
    "output_specification": "OutputFor each test case, output a single integer: the maximum possible size of a deck if you operate optimally.",

    "statement": "Firefly is given an array a of length n. Let c_i denote the i'th cyclic shift^{\\text{∗}} of a. She creates a new array b such that b = c_1 + c_2 + ... + c_n where + represents concatenation^{\\text{†}}. Then, she asks you q queries. For each query, output the sum of all elements in the subarray of b that starts from the l-th element and ends at the r-th element, inclusive of both ends.^{\\text{∗}}The x-th (1 ≤q x ≤q n) cyclic shift of the array a is a_x, a_{x+1} ... a_n, a_1, a_2 ... a_{x - 1}. Note that the 1-st shift is the initial a.^{\\text{†}}The concatenation of two arrays p and q of length n (in other words, p + q) is p_1, p_2, ..., p_n, q_1, q_2, ..., q_n.",
    "input_specification": "InputThe first line contains t (1 ≤q t ≤q 10^4) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 ≤q n, q ≤q 2 · 10^5) — the length of the array and the number of queries.The following line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤q a_i ≤q 10^6).The following q lines contain two integers l and r (1 ≤q l ≤q r ≤q n^2) — the left and right bounds of the query.Note that the large inputs may require the use of 64-bit integers.It is guaranteed that the sum of n does not exceed 2 · 10^5 and the sum of q does not exceed 2 · 10^5.",

You choose n cells (x_1,y_1), (x_2,y_2),...,(x_n,y_n) in the grid n× n where 1≤ x_i≤ n and 1≤ y_i≤ n.Let \\mathcal{H} be the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells. Your task is to maximize the size of \\mathcal{H}. Examples of sets and their construction are given in the notes.If there exists more than one solution, you are allowed to output any.Manhattan distance between cells (x_1,y_1) and (x_2,y_2) equals |x_1-x_2|+|y_1-y_2|.",

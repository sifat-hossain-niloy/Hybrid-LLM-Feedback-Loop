    "statement": "Polycarp was given an array a of n integers. He really likes triples of numbers, so for each j (1 ≤ j ≤ n - 2) he wrote down a triple of elements [a_j, a_{j + 1}, a_{j + 2}].Polycarp considers a pair of triples b and c beautiful if they differ in exactly one position, that is, one of the following conditions is satisfied: b_1 ≠ c_1 and b_2 = c_2 and b_3 = c_3; b_1 = c_1 and b_2 ≠ c_2 and b_3 = c_3; b_1 = c_1 and b_2 = c_2 and b_3 ≠ c_3. Find the number of beautiful pairs of triples among the written triples [a_j, a_{j + 1}, a_{j + 2}].",
    "input_specification": "InputThe first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) — the length of the array a.The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) — the elements of the array.It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases in the test does not exceed 2 · 10^5.",
    "output_specification": "OutputFor each test case, output a single integer — the number of beautiful pairs of triples among the pairs of the form [a_j, a_{j + 1}, a_{j + 2}].Note that the answer may not fit into 32-bit data types.",

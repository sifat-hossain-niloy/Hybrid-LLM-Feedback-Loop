    "statement": "t+pazolite, ginkiha, Hommarju - Paved Garden⠀You are given a tree with n nodes, rooted at node 1. In this problem, a leaf is a non-root node with degree 1.In one operation, you can remove a leaf and the edge adjacent to it (possibly, new leaves appear). What is the minimum number of operations that you have to perform to get a tree, also rooted at node 1, where all the leaves are at the same distance from the root?",
    "input_specification": "InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3 ≤q n ≤q 5 · 10^5) — the number of nodes.Each of the next n-1 lines contains two integers u, v (1 ≤q u, v ≤q n, u ≠q v), describing an edge that connects u and v. It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 · 10^5.",

    "statement": "Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero): choose an index i (2 ≤ i ≤ |a| - 1) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1}, and replace a_i with a_{i - 1}. You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. What is the minimum number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then output -1.",

An array consisting of identical numbers will remain beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.\nIn the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index\n5\n, for example.\nThe resulting array will be\n[1,2,1,2]\n. Let's check if it is beautiful. Two operations are available:\nThus, the array\n[1,2,1,2]\nis not beautiful.\nIn the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.

    "statement": "Being a physicist, Charlie likes to plan his life in simple and precise terms. For the next m months, starting with no money, Charlie will work hard and earn x pounds per month. For the i-th month (1 ≤ i ≤ m), there'll be a single opportunity of paying cost c_i pounds to obtain happiness h_i.Borrowing is not allowed. Money earned in the i-th month can only be spent in a later j-th month (j>i).Since physicists don't code, help Charlie find the maximum obtainable sum of happiness.",
    "input_specification": "InputThe first line of input contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains two integers, m and x (1 ≤ m ≤ 50, 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8) — the total number of months and the monthly salary.The i-th of the following m lines contains two integers, c_i and h_i (0 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^8, 1 ≤ h_i ≤ 10^3) — the cost and happiness on offer for the i-th month. Note that some happiness may be free (c_i=0 for some i's).It is guaranteed that the sum of ∑_i h_i over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.",
    "output_specification": "OutputFor each test case, print a single integer, the maximum sum of happiness Charlie could obtain.",

    "statement": "One fine evening, Alice sat down to play the classic game \"Connect the Dots\", but with a twist.To play the game, Alice draws a straight line and marks n points on it, indexed from 1 to n. Initially, there are no arcs between the points, so they are all disjoint. After that, Alice performs m operations of the following type: She picks three integers a_i, d_i (1 ≤ d_i ≤ 10), and k_i. She selects points a_i, a_i+d_i, a_i+2d_i, a_i+3d_i, ..., a_i+k_i· d_i and connects each pair of these points with arcs. After performing all m operations, she wants to know the number of connected components^\\dagger these points form. Please help her find this number.^\\dagger Two points are said to be in one connected component if there is a path between them via several (possibly zero) arcs and other points.",
    "input_specification": "InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5). The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5).The i-th of the following m lines contains three integers a_i, d_i, and k_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ a_i + k_i· d_i ≤ n, 1 ≤ d_i ≤ 10, 0 ≤ k_i ≤ n).It is guaranteed that both the sum of n and the sum of m over all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^5.",

    "note": "In the first test case, there are\nn=10\npoints. The first operation joins the points\n1\n,\n3\n,\n5\n,\n7\n, and\n9\n. The second operation joins the points\n2\n,\n4\n,\n6\n,\n8\n, and\n10\n. There are thus two connected components:\n{1,3,5,7,9}\nand\n{2,4,6,8,10}\n.\nIn the second test case, there are\nn=100\npoints. The only operation joins the points\n19\n,\n21\n,\n23\n,\n25\n, and\n27\n. Now all of them form a single connected component of size\n5\n. The other\n95\npoints form single-point connected components. Thus, the answer is\n1+95=96\n.\nIn the third test case, there are\nn=100\npoints. After the operations, all odd points from\n1\nto\n79\nwill be in one connected component of size\n40\n. The other\n60\npoints form single-point connected components. Thus, the answer is\n1+60=61\n.",

Find the minimum number of operations required to make the array a satisfy the condition: For every pairwise distinct triplet of indices (x, y, z) (1 ≤ x, y, z ≤ n, x ≠ y, y ≠ z, x ≠ z), there exists a non-degenerate triangle with side lengths a_x, a_y and a_z, i.e. a_x + a_y > a_z, a_y + a_z > a_x and a_z + a_x > a_y.",

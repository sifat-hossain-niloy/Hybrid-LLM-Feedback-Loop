    "statement": "You have some cards. An integer between 1 and n is written on each card: specifically, for each i from 1 to n, you have a_i cards which have the number i written on them.There is also a shop which contains unlimited cards of each type. You have k coins, so you can buy k new cards in total, and the cards you buy can contain any integer between 1 and n.After buying the new cards, you rearrange all your cards in a line. The score of a rearrangement is the number of (contiguous) subarrays of length n which are a permutation of [1, 2, ..., n]. What's the maximum score you can get?",
    "input_specification": "InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t\\ (1≤ t≤ 100). The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains two integers n, k (1≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 0≤ k ≤ 10^{12}) — the number of distinct types of cards and the number of coins.The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^{12}) — the number of cards of type i you have at the beginning.It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 · 10^5.",

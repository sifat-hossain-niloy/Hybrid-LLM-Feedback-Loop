    "statement": "Shirobon - FOX⠀You are given n points on the x axis, at increasing positive integer coordinates x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_n.For each pair (i, j) with 1 ≤q i < j ≤q n, you draw the segment [x_i, x_j]. The segments are closed, i.e., a segment [a, b] contains the points a, a+1, ..., b.You are given q queries. In the i-th query, you are given a positive integer k_i, and you have to determine how many points with integer coordinates are contained in exactly k_i segments.",
    "input_specification": "InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains two integers n, q (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ q ≤ 10^5) — the number of points and the number of queries.The second line of each test case contains n integers x_1, x_2, ..., x_n (1 ≤q x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_n ≤q 10^9) — the coordinates of the n points.The third line of each test case contains q integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_q (1 ≤q k_i ≤q 10^{18}) — the parameters of the q queries.It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.",

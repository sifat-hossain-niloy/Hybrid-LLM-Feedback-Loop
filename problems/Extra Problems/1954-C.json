    "statement": "You are given two integers x and y of the same length, consisting of digits from 1 to 9.You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero): swap the i-th digit in x and the i-th digit in y.For example, if x=73 and y=31, you can swap the 2-nd digits and get x=71 and y=33.Your task is to maximize the product of x and y using the aforementioned operation any number of times. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.",
    "input_specification": "InputThe first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains a single integer x (1 ≤ x < 10^{100}).The second line of each test case contains a single integer y (1 ≤ y < 10^{100}).Additional constraint on input: the integers x and y consist only of digits from 1 to 9.",
    "output_specification": "OutputFor each test case, print two lines — the first line should contain the number x after performing the operations; similarly, the second line should contain the number y after performing the operations. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.",

    "statement": "You're given an array a initially containing n integers. In one operation, you must do the following: Choose a position i such that 1 < i ≤ |a| and a_i = |a| + 1 - i, where |a| is the current size of the array. Append i - 1 zeros onto the end of a. After performing this operation as many times as you want, what is the maximum possible length of the array a?",
    "input_specification": "InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000). The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) — the length of the array a.The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^{12}).It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.",

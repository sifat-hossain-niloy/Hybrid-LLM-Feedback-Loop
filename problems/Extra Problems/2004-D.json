    "statement": "There are n cities located on a straight line. The cities are numbered from 1 to n.Portals are used to move between cities. There are 4 colors of portals: blue, green, red, and yellow. Each city has portals of two different colors. You can move from city i to city j if they have portals of the same color (for example, you can move between a \"blue-red\" city and a \"blue-green\" city). This movement costs |i-j| coins.Your task is to answer q independent queries: calculate the minimum cost to move from city x to city y.",
    "input_specification": "InputThe first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 ≤ n, q ≤ 2 · 10^5) — the number of cities and the number of queries, respectively.The second line contains n strings of the following types: BG, BR, BY, GR, GY, or RY; the i-th of them describes the portals located in the i-th city; the symbol B indicates that there is a blue portal in the city, G — green, R — red, and Y — yellow.The j-th of the next q lines contains two integers x_j and y_j (1 ≤ x_j, y_j ≤ n) — the description of the j-th query.Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.",
    "output_specification": "OutputFor each query, print a single integer — the minimum cost to move from city x to city y (or -1 if it is impossible).",

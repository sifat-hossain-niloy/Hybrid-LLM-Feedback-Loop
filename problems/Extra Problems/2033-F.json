    "statement": "Kosuke is too lazy. He will not give you any legend, just the task:Fibonacci numbers are defined as follows: f(1)=f(2)=1. f(n)=f(n-1)+f(n-2) (3≤ n) We denote G(n,k) as an index of the n-th Fibonacci number that is divisible by k. For given n and k, compute G(n,k).As this number can be too big, output it by modulo 10^9+7.For example: G(3,2)=9 because the 3-rd Fibonacci number that is divisible by 2 is 34. [1,1,\\textbf{2},3,5,\\textbf{8},13,21,\\textbf{34}].",
    "input_specification": "InputThe first line of the input data contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases.The first and only line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^{18}, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5).It is guaranteed that the sum of k across all test cases does not exceed 10^6.",
    "output_specification": "OutputFor each test case, output the only number: the value G(n,k) taken by modulo 10^9+7.",

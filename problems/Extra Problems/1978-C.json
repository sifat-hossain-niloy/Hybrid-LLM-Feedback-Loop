    "statement": "Let's call the Manhattan value of a permutation^{\\dagger} p the value of the expression |p_1 - 1| + |p_2 - 2| + ... + |p_n - n|.For example, for the permutation [1, 2, 3], the Manhattan value is |1 - 1| + |2 - 2| + |3 - 3| = 0, and for the permutation [3, 1, 2], the Manhattan value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4.You are given integers n and k. Find a permutation p of length n such that its Manhattan value is equal to k, or determine that no such permutation exists.^{\\dagger}A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).",
    "input_specification": "InputEach test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤q t ≤q 10^{4}) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^{5}, 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^{12}) — the length of the permutation and the required Manhattan value.It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^{5}.",
    "output_specification": "OutputFor each test case, if there is no suitable permutation, output \"No\". Otherwise, in the first line, output \"Yes\", and in the second line, output n distinct integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_n (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n) — a suitable permutation.If there are multiple solutions, output any of them.You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings \"yEs\", \"yes\", \"Yes\", and \"YES\" will be recognized as a positive answer).",

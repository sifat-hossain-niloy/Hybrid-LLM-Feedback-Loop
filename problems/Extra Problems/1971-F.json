    "statement": "Given an integer r, find the number of lattice points that have a Euclidean distance from (0, 0) greater than or equal to r but strictly less than r+1.A lattice point is a point with integer coordinates. The Euclidean distance from (0, 0) to the point (x,y) is \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}.",
    "input_specification": "InputThe first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤q t ≤q 1000) — the number of test cases.The only line of each test case contains a single integer r (1 ≤q r ≤q 10^5).The sum of r over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.",
    "output_specification": "OutputFor each test case, output a single integer — the number of lattice points that have an Euclidean distance d from (0, 0) such that r ≤q d < r+1.",

    "statement": "Alice and Bob are playing a game on n piles of stones. On each player's turn, they select a positive integer k that is at most the size of the smallest nonempty pile and remove k stones from each nonempty pile at once. The first player who is unable to make a move (because all piles are empty) loses.Given that Alice goes first, who will win the game if both players play optimally?",
    "input_specification": "InputThe first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2· 10^5) — the number of piles in the game.The next line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ... a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), where a_i is the initial number of stones in the i-th pile.It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2· 10^5.",

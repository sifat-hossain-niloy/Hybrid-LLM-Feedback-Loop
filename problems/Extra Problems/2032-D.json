    "statement": "This is an interactive problem.Upon clearing the Waterside Area, Gretel has found a monster named Genokraken, and she's keeping it contained for her scientific studies.The monster's nerve system can be structured as a tree^{\\dagger} of n nodes (really, everything should stop resembling trees all the time...), numbered from 0 to n-1, with node 0 as the root.Gretel's objective is to learn the exact structure of the monster's nerve system — more specifically, she wants to know the values p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n-1} of the tree, where p_i (0 ≤ p_i < i) is the direct parent node of node i (1 ≤ i ≤ n - 1).She doesn't know exactly how the nodes are placed, but she knows a few convenient facts: If we remove root node 0 and all adjacent edges, this tree will turn into a forest consisting of only paths^{\\ddagger}. Each node that was initially adjacent to the node 0 will be the end of some path. The nodes are indexed in a way that if 1 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ n - 1, then p_x ≤ p_y. Node 1 has exactly two adjacent nodes (including the node 0). The tree in this picture does not satisfy the condition, because if we remove node 0, then node 2 (which was initially adjacent to the node 0) will not be the end of the path 4-2-5.The tree in this picture does not satisfy the condition, because p_3 ≤ p_4 must hold.The tree in this picture does not satisfy the condition, because node 1 has only one adjacent node. Gretel can make queries to the containment cell: \"? a b\" (1 ≤ a, b < n, a ≠ b) — the cell will check if the simple path between nodes a and b contains the node 0. However, to avoid unexpected consequences by overstimulating the creature, Gretel wants to query at most 2n - 6 times. Though Gretel is gifted, she can't do everything all at once, so can you give her a helping hand?^{\\dagger}A tree is a connected graph where every pair of distinct nodes has exactly one simple path connecting them.^{\\ddagger}A path is a tree whose vertices can be listed in the order v_1, v_2, ..., v_k such that the edges are (v_i, v_{i+1}) (1 ≤ i < k).",

    "statement": "You are given n arrays a_1, ..., a_n. The length of each array is two. Thus, a_i = [a_{i, 1}, a_{i, 2}]. You need to concatenate the arrays into a single array of length 2n such that the number of inversions^{\\dagger} in the resulting array is minimized. Note that you do not need to count the actual number of inversions.More formally, you need to choose a permutation^{\\ddagger} p of length n, so that the array b = [a_{p_1,1}, a_{p_1,2}, a_{p_2, 1}, a_{p_2, 2}, ..., a_{p_n,1}, a_{p_n,2}] contains as few inversions as possible.^{\\dagger}The number of inversions in an array c is the number of pairs of indices i and j such that i < j and c_i > c_j.^{\\ddagger}A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).",
    "input_specification": "InputEach test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the number of arrays.Each of the following n lines contains two integers a_{i,1} and a_{i,2} (1 ≤ a_{i,j} ≤ 10^9) — the elements of the i-th array.It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.",

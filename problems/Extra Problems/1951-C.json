The tickets will be on sale for n days, and by some time travelling, you have predicted that the price per ticket at day i will be a_i. However, to prevent ticket hoarding, the concert organizers have implemented the following measures: A person may purchase no more than m tickets per day. If a person purchases x tickets on day i, all subsequent days (i.e. from day i+1 onwards) will have their prices per ticket increased by x. For example, if a = [1, 3, 8, 4, 5] and you purchase 2 tickets on day 1, they will cost 2 in total, and the prices from day 2 onwards will become [5, 10, 6, 7]. If you then purchase 3 more tickets on day 2, they will cost in total an additional 15, and the prices from day 3 onwards will become [13, 9, 10].Find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets.",

The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains three integers n, m, and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ \\min(nm, 10^9)) — the number of sale days, the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day, and the number of tickets to be bought at the end.The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) — the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days.It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.",

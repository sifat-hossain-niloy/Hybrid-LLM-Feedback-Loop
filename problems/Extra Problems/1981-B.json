    "statement": "There is a sequence a_0, a_1, a_2, ... of infinite length. Initially a_i = i for every non-negative integer i.After every second, each element of the sequence will simultaneously change. a_i will change to a_{i - 1} \\mid a_i \\mid a_{i + 1} for every positive integer i. a_0 will change to a_0 \\mid a_1. Here, | denotes bitwise OR.Turtle is asked to find the value of a_n after m seconds. In particular, if m = 0, then he needs to find the initial value of a_n. He is tired of calculating so many values, so please help him!",

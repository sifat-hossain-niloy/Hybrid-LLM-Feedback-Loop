    "statement": "You are given two integers n and k. Find a sequence a of non-negative integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold. There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k. For all 1 ≤ v ≤ n where v ≠ k, there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v. A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2, 4, 3].It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.",
    "input_specification": "InputThe first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ k ≤ n) — the parameters described above. It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7.",
    "output_specification": "OutputThe first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 25) — the size of your chosen sequence.The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) — the elements of your chosen sequence.If there are multiple solutions, print any.",

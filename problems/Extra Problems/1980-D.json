    "statement": "GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of two integers x and y is the maximum integer z by which both x and y are divisible. For example, GCD(36, 48) = 12, GCD(5, 10) = 5, and GCD(7,11) = 1.Kristina has an array a consisting of exactly n positive integers. She wants to count the GCD of each neighbouring pair of numbers to get a new array b, called GCD-sequence. So, the elements of the GCD-sequence b will be calculated using the formula b_i = GCD(a_i, a_{i + 1}) for 1 ≤ i ≤ n - 1.Determine whether it is possible to remove exactly one number from the array a so that the GCD sequence b is non-decreasing (i.e., b_i ≤ b_{i+1} is always true).For example, let Khristina had an array a = [20, 6, 12, 3, 48, 36]. If she removes a_4 = 3 from it and counts the GCD-sequence of b, she gets: b_1 = GCD(20, 6) = 2 b_2 = GCD(6, 12) = 6 b_3 = GCD(12, 48) = 12 b_4 = GCD(48, 36) = 12 The resulting GCD sequence b = [2,6,12,12] is non-decreasing because b_1 ≤ b_2 ≤ b_3 ≤ b_4.",
    "input_specification": "InputThe first line of input data contains a single number t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — he number of test cases in the test.This is followed by the descriptions of the test cases.The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) — the number of elements in the array a.The second line of each test case contains exactly n integers a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) — the elements of array a.It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test case does not exceed 2 · 10^5.",
    "output_specification": "OutputFor each test case, output a single line: \"YES\" if you can remove exactly one number from the array a so that the GCD-sequence of b is non-decreasing; \"NO\" otherwise. You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings \"yEs\", \"yes\", \"Yes\", and \"YES\" will all be recognized as a positive answer).",

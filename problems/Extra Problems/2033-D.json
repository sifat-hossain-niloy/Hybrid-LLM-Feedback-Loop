    "statement": "After a trip with Sakurako, Kousuke was very scared because he forgot about his programming assignment. In this assignment, the teacher gave him an array a of n integers and asked him to calculate the number of non-overlapping segments of the array a, such that each segment is considered beautiful.A segment [l,r] is considered beautiful if a_l + a_{l+1} + ... + a_{r-1} + a_r=0.For a fixed array a, your task is to compute the maximum number of non-overlapping beautiful segments.",
    "input_specification": "InputThe first line of input contains the number t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases. Each test case consists of 2 lines. The first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the length of the array. The second line contains n integers a_i (-10^5 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^5) — the elements of the array a. It is guaranteed that the sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 3· 10^5.",
    "output_specification": "OutputFor each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-overlapping beautiful segments.",

    "statement": "Sakurako has prepared a task for you:She gives you an array of n integers and allows you to choose i and j such that i ≠q j and a_i ≥ a_j, and then assign a_i = a_i - a_j or a_i = a_i + a_j. You can perform this operation any number of times for any i and j, as long as they satisfy the conditions.Sakurako asks you what is the maximum possible value of mex_k^{\\text{∗}} of the array after any number of operations.^{\\text{∗}}mex_k is the k-th non-negative integer that is absent in the array. For example, mex_1(\\{1,2,3 \\})=0, since 0 is the first element that is not in the array, and mex_2(\\{0,2,4 \\})=3, since 3 is the second element that is not in the array.",
    "input_specification": "InputThe first line contains a single integer t (1≤ t≤ 10^4)  — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1≤ n≤ 2· 10^5,1≤ k≤ 10^9)  — the number of elements in the array and the value k for mex_k.The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ...,a_n (1≤ a_i≤ 10^9)  — the elements of the array.It is guaranteed that the sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2· 10^5.",

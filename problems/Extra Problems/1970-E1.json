    "statement": "Harry Potter is hiking in the Alps surrounding Lake Geneva. In this area there are m cabins, numbered 1 to m. Each cabin is connected, with one or more trails, to a central meeting point next to the lake. Each trail is either short or long. Cabin i is connected with s_i short trails and l_i long trails to the lake.Each day, Harry walks a trail from the cabin where he currently is to Lake Geneva, and then from there he walks a trail to any of the m cabins (including the one he started in). However, as he has to finish the hike in a day, at least one of the two trails has to be short.How many possible combinations of trails can Harry take if he starts in cabin 1 and walks for n days?Give the answer modulo 10^9 + 7.",
    "input_specification": "InputThe first line contains the integers m and n.The second line contains m integers, s_1, ..., s_m, where s_i is the number of short trails between cabin i and Lake Geneva.The third and last line contains m integers, l_1, ..., l_m, where l_i is the number of long trails between cabin i and Lake Geneva.We have the following constraints:0 ≤ s_i, l_i ≤ 10^3.1 ≤ m ≤ 10^2.1 ≤ n ≤ 10^3.",

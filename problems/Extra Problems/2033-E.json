    "statement": "Sakurako's exams are over, and she did excellently. As a reward, she received a permutation p. Kosuke was not entirely satisfied because he failed one exam and did not receive a gift. He decided to sneak into her room (thanks to the code for her lock) and spoil the permutation so that it becomes simple.A permutation p is considered simple if for every i (1≤ i ≤ n) one of the following conditions holds: p_i=i p_{p_i}=i For example, the permutations [1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 2, 4, 3, 1], and [2, 1] are simple, while [2, 3, 1] and [5, 2, 1, 4, 3] are not.In one operation, Kosuke can choose indices i,j (1≤ i,j≤ n) and swap the elements p_i and p_j.Sakurako is about to return home. Your task is to calculate the minimum number of operations that Kosuke needs to perform to make the permutation simple.",
    "input_specification": "InputThe first line contains one integer t (1≤ t≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases.Each test case is described by two lines. The first line contains one integer n (1≤ n ≤ 10^6) — the length of the permutation p. The second line contains n integers p_i (1≤ p_i≤ n) — the elements of the permutation p. It is guaranteed that the sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 10^6.It is guaranteed that p is a permutation.",
    "output_specification": "OutputFor each test case, output the minimum number of operations that Kosuke needs to perform to make the permutation simple.",

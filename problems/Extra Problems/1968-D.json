    "statement": "Bodya and Sasha found a permutation p_1,...,p_n and an array a_1,...,a_n. They decided to play a well-known \"Permutation game\".A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).Both of them chose a starting position in the permutation.The game lasts k turns. The players make moves simultaneously. On each turn, two things happen to each player: If the current position of the player is x, his score increases by a_x. Then the player either stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x. The winner of the game is the player with the higher score after exactly k turns.Knowing Bodya's starting position P_B and Sasha's starting position P_S, determine who wins the game if both players are trying to win.",
    "input_specification": "InputThe first line contains a single integer t (1≤ t≤ 10^4) — the number of testcases.The first line of each testcase contains integers n, k, P_B, P_S (1≤ P_B,P_S≤ n≤ 2· 10^5, 1≤ k≤ 10^9) — length of the permutation, duration of the game, starting positions respectively.The next line contains n integers p_1,...,p_n (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n) — elements of the permutation p.The next line contains n integers a_1,...,a_n (1≤ a_i≤ 10^9) — elements of array a.It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.",
    "output_specification": "OutputFor each testcase output: \"Bodya\" if Bodya wins the game. \"Sasha\" if Sasha wins the game. \"Draw\" if the players have the same score.",

    "statement": "Imagine you have n light bulbs numbered 1, 2, ..., n. Initially, all bulbs are on. To flip the state of a bulb means to turn it off if it used to be on, and to turn it on otherwise.Next, you do the following: for each i = 1, 2, ..., n, flip the state of all bulbs j such that j is divisible by i^\\dagger. After performing all operations, there will be several bulbs that are still on. Your goal is to make this number exactly k.Find the smallest suitable n such that after performing the operations there will be exactly k bulbs on. We can show that an answer always exists.^\\dagger An integer x is divisible by y if there exists an integer z such that x = y· z.",

    "statement": "Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, Chamo gave her an array a consisting of n positive integers as a gift.Mocha doesn't like arrays containing different numbers, so Mocha decides to use magic to change the array. Mocha can perform the following three-step operation some (possibly, zero) times: Choose indices l and r (1 ≤q l < r ≤q n) Let x be the median^\\dagger of the subarray [a_l, a_{l+1},..., a_r] Set all values a_l, a_{l+1},..., a_r to x Suppose a=[1,2,3,4,5] initially: If Mocha chooses (l,r)=(3,4) in the first operation, then x=3, the array will be changed into a=[1,2,3,3,5]. If Mocha chooses (l,r)=(1,3) in the first operation, then x=2, the array will be changed into a=[2,2,2,4,5]. Mocha will perform the operation until the array contains only the same number. Mocha wants to know what is the maximum possible value of this number.^\\dagger The median in an array b of length m is an element that occupies position number \\lfloor \\frac{m+1}{2} \\rfloor after we sort the elements in non-decreasing order. For example, the median of [3,1,4,1,5] is 3 and the median of [5,25,20,24] is 20.",
    "input_specification": "InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1≤q t≤q 500). The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2≤q n≤q 10^5) — the length of the array a.The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,...,a_n (1≤q a_i ≤q 10^9) — the elements of the array a.It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.",

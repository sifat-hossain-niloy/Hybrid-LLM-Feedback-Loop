    "statement": "QED is given a permutation^{\\text{∗}} p of length n. He also has a string s of length n containing only characters \\texttt{L} and \\texttt{R}. QED only likes permutations that are sorted in non-decreasing order. To sort p, he can select any of the following operations and perform them any number of times: Choose an index i such that s_i = \\texttt{L}. Then, swap p_i and p_{i-1}. It is guaranteed that s_1 ≠q \\texttt{L}. Choose an index i such that s_i = \\texttt{R}. Then, swap p_i and p_{i+1}. It is guaranteed that s_n ≠q \\texttt{R}. He is also given q queries. In each query, he selects an index i and changes s_i from \\texttt{L} to \\texttt{R} (or from \\texttt{R} to \\texttt{L}). Note that the changes are persistent. After each query, he asks you if it is possible to sort p in non-decreasing order by performing the aforementioned operations any number of times. Note that before answering each query, the permutation p is reset to its original form.^{\\text{∗}}A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).",

It is guaranteed that s_i is either \\texttt{L} or \\texttt{R}, s_1 = \\texttt{R}, and s_n = \\texttt{L}.The following q lines contain an integer i (2 ≤q i ≤q n-1), denoting that s_i is changed from \\texttt{L} to \\texttt{R} (or from \\texttt{R} to \\texttt{L}). It is guaranteed that the sum of n and q over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.",

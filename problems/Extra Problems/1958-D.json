    "statement": "There is a staircase consisting of n steps. Each step is either intact, or broken. For each broken step, an integer a_i is given denoting the difficulty of repairing it.Every day, you can either: repair an arbitrary broken step. The effort it takes to repair the i-th step is equal to a_i; or repair two adjacent broken steps. The effort it takes to repair both the i-th step and the (i+1)-th step is equal to 2 · (a_i+a_{i+1}). You want to repair all broken steps of the staircase, and you want to do it in the minimum possible number of days. What is the minimum total effort it will take to repair all broken steps in the minimum number of days?",
    "input_specification": "InputThe first line contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases.Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) — the number of steps; the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^8). If a_i = 0, then the i-th step does not need to be repaired; otherwise, the i-th step is broken and a_i is the difficulty of repairing it. Additional constraint on the input: the sum of values of n does not exceed 3 · 10^5.",

    "statement": "Fox loves permutations! She came up with the following problem and asked Cat to solve it:You are given an even positive integer n and a permutation^\\dagger p of length n. The score of another permutation q of length n is the number of local maximums in the array a of length n, where a_i = p_i + q_i for all i (1 ≤ i ≤ n). In other words, the score of q is the number of i such that 1 < i < n (note the strict inequalities), a_{i-1} < a_i, and a_i > a_{i+1} (once again, note the strict inequalities). Find the permutation q that achieves the maximum score for given n and p. If there exist multiple such permutations, you can pick any of them.^\\dagger A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).",
    "input_specification": "InputThe first line of input contains an integer t (1 ≤q t ≤q 10^4) — the number of test cases in the input you will have to solve.The first line of each test case contains one even integer n (4 ≤q n ≤q 10^5, n is even) — the length of the permutation p.The second line of each test case contains the n integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_n (1 ≤q p_i ≤q n). It is guaranteed that p is a permutation of length n.It is guaranteed that the sum of n across all test cases doesn't exceed 10^5.",
    "output_specification": "OutputFor each test case, output one line containing any permutation of length n (the array q), such that q maximizes the score under the given constraints.",

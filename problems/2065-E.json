Its balance-value is defined as the value of\nmax(x−y,y−x)\n.\nSkibidus gives you three integers\nn\n,\nm\n, and\nk\n. He asks for your help to construct a binary string\ns\nof length\nn+m\nwith exactly\nn\n0\n's and\nm\n1\n's such that the maximum balance-value among all of its substrings\n†\nis exactly\nk\n. If it is not possible, output -1.\n∗\nA binary string only consists of characters\n0\nand\n1\n.\n†\nA string\na\nis a substring of a string\nb\nif\na\ncan be obtained from\nb\nby the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the end.",

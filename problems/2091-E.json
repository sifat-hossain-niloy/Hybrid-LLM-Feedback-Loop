    "statement": "Recently, Misha at the IT Campus \"NEIMARK\" camp learned a new topic — the Euclidean algorithm.He was somewhat surprised when he realized that a · b = lcm(a, b) · gcd(a, b), where gcd(a, b) — is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numbers a and b and lcm(a, b) — is the least common multiple (LCM). Misha thought that since the product of LCM and GCD exists, it might be interesting to consider their quotient: F(a,b)=\\frac{lcm(a, b)}{gcd(a, b)}.For example, he took a = 2 and b = 4, computed F(2, 4) = \\frac{4}{2} = 2 and obtained a prime number (a number is prime if it has exactly two divisors)! Now he considers F(a, b) to be an interesting ratio if a < b and F(a, b) is a prime number.Since Misha has just started studying number theory, he needs your help to calculate — how many different pairs of numbers a and b are there such that F(a, b) is an interesting ratio and 1 ≤q a < b ≤q n?",
    "input_specification": "InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤q t ≤q 10^3). The description of the test cases follows.A single line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 ≤q n ≤q 10^7).It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7.",
    "output_specification": "OutputFor each test case, output the number of interesting ratios F(a, b) for pairs satisfying 1 ≤q a < b ≤q n.",

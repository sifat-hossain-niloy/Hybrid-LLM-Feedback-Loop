    "statement": "Gellyfish hates math problems, but she has to finish her math homework:Gellyfish is given an array of n positive integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n.She needs to do the following two-step operation until all elements of a are equal: Select two indexes i, j satisfying 1 ≤q i, j ≤q n and i ≠q j. Replace a_i with \\gcd(a_i, a_j). Now, Gellyfish asks you for the minimum number of operations to achieve her goal.It can be proven that Gellyfish can always achieve her goal.",
    "input_specification": "InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 ≤q n ≤q 5000) — the length of the array.The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,...,a_n (1 ≤q a_i ≤q 5000) — the elements of the array.It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5000.",

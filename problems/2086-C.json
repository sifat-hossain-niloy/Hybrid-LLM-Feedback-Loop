    "statement": "A permutation of integers from 1 to n is an array of size n where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly once.You are given a permutation p of integers from 1 to n. You have to process n queries. During the i-th query, you replace p_{d_i} with 0. Each element is replaced with 0 exactly once. The changes made in the queries are saved, that is, after the i-th query, all integers p_{d_1}, p_{d_2}, ..., p_{d_i} are zeroes.After each query, you have to find the minimum number of operations required to fix the array; in other words, to transform the current array into any permutation of integers from 1 to n (possibly into the original permutation p, possibly into some other permutation).The operation you can perform to fix the array is the following one: choose the integer i from 1 to n, replace the i-th element of the array with i. Note that the answer for each query is calculated independently, meaning you do not actually apply any operations, just calculate the minimum number of operations.",
    "input_specification": "InputEach test consists of several test cases. The first line contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^{4}) — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^{5}).The second line of each test case contains n integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_n (1 ≤ p_{i} ≤ n) — the original permutation. All p_i are distinct.The third line of each test case contains n integers d_1, d_2, ..., d_n (1 ≤ d_{i} ≤ n). All d_{i} are distinct.Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^{5}.",
    "output_specification": "OutputFor each test case, output a line containing n integers, where the i-th integer should be equal to the minimum number of operations required to fix the array which was obtained after the i-th query (i.e., the permutation p where all integers p_{d_1}, p_{d_2}, ..., p_{d_i} are replaced by zeroes).",

    "statement": "Given three integers l, r, and G, find two integers A and B (l ≤ A ≤ B ≤ r) such that their greatest common divisor (GCD) equals G and the distance |A - B| is maximized.If there are multiple such pairs, choose the one where A is minimized. If no such pairs exist, output \"-1 -1\".",
    "input_specification": "InputThe first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3) — the number of test cases. Then, t test cases follow.Each test case consists of a single line containing three integers l, r, G (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^{18}; 1 ≤ G ≤ 10^{18}) — the range boundaries and the required GCD.",
    "output_specification": "OutputFor each test case, output two integers A and B — the solution to the problem, or \"-1 -1\" if no such pair exists.",

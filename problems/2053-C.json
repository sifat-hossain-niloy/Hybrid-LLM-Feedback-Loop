    "statement": "I'm praying for owning a transparent heart; as well as eyes with tears more than enough...\n— Escape Plan, Brightest Star in the Dark\nIris looked at the stars and a beautiful problem emerged in her mind. She is inviting you to solve it so that a meteor shower is believed to form.\nThere are\n𝑛\nstars in the sky, arranged in a row. Iris has a telescope, which she uses to look at the stars.\nInitially, Iris observes stars in the segment\n[1,𝑛]\n, and she has a lucky value of\n0\n. Iris wants to look for the star in the middle position for each segment\n[𝑙,𝑟]\nthat she observes. So the following recursive procedure is used:\nFirst, she will calculate\n𝑚=⌊\n𝑙+𝑟\n2\n⌋\n.\nIf the length of the segment (i.e.\n𝑟−𝑙+1\n) is even, Iris will divide it into two equally long segments\n[𝑙,𝑚]\nand\n[𝑚+1,𝑟]\nfor further observation.\nOtherwise, Iris will aim the telescope at star\n𝑚\n, and her lucky value will increase by\n𝑚\n; subsequently, if\n𝑙≠𝑟\n, Iris will continue to observe two segments\n[𝑙,𝑚−1]\nand\n[𝑚+1,𝑟]\n.\nIris is a bit lazy. She defines her laziness by an integer\n𝑘\n: as the observation progresses, she will not continue to observe any segment\n[𝑙,𝑟]\nwith a length strictly less than\n𝑘\n. In this case, please predict her final lucky value.",
    "input_specification": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a single integer\n𝑡\n(\n1≤𝑡≤\n10\n5\n) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.\nThe only line of each test case contains two integers\n𝑛\nand\n𝑘\n(\n1≤𝑘≤𝑛≤2⋅\n10\n9\n).",

    "note": "In the first test case, at the beginning, Iris observes\n[1,7]\n. Since\n[1,7]\nhas an odd length, she aims at star\n4\nand therefore increases her lucky value by\n4\n. Then it is split into\n2\nnew segments:\n[1,3]\nand\n[5,7]\n. The segment\n[1,3]\nagain has an odd length, so Iris aims at star\n2\nand increases her lucky value by\n2\n. Then it is split into\n2\nnew segments:\n[1,1]\nand\n[3,3]\n, both having a length less than\n2\n, so no further observation is conducted. For range\n[5,7]\n, the progress is similar and the lucky value eventually increases by\n6\n. Therefore, the final lucky value is\n4+2+6=12\n.\nIn the last test case, Iris finally observes all the stars and the final lucky value is\n1+2+⋯+8765432=38416403456028\n.",

    "statement": "I'm praying for owning a transparent heart; as well as eyes with tears more than enough...— Escape Plan, Brightest Star in the DarkIris looked at the stars and a beautiful problem emerged in her mind. She is inviting you to solve it so that a meteor shower is believed to form.There are n stars in the sky, arranged in a row. Iris has a telescope, which she uses to look at the stars.Initially, Iris observes stars in the segment [1, n], and she has a lucky value of 0. Iris wants to look for the star in the middle position for each segment [l, r] that she observes. So the following recursive procedure is used: First, she will calculate m = ≤ft\\lfloor \\frac{l+r}{2} \\right\\rfloor. If the length of the segment (i.e. r - l + 1) is even, Iris will divide it into two equally long segments [l, m] and [m+1, r] for further observation. Otherwise, Iris will aim the telescope at star m, and her lucky value will increase by m; subsequently, if l ≠q r, Iris will continue to observe two segments [l, m-1] and [m+1, r]. Iris is a bit lazy. She defines her laziness by an integer k: as the observation progresses, she will not continue to observe any segment [l, r] with a length strictly less than k. In this case, please predict her final lucky value.",

    "note": "In the first test case, at the beginning, Iris observes\n[1,7]\n. Since\n[1,7]\nhas an odd length, she aims at star\n4\nand therefore increases her lucky value by\n4\n. Then it is split into\n2\nnew segments:\n[1,3]\nand\n[5,7]\n. The segment\n[1,3]\nagain has an odd length, so Iris aims at star\n2\nand increases her lucky value by\n2\n. Then it is split into\n2\nnew segments:\n[1,1]\nand\n[3,3]\n, both having a length less than\n2\n, so no further observation is conducted. For range\n[5,7]\n, the progress is similar and the lucky value eventually increases by\n6\n. Therefore, the final lucky value is\n4+2+6=12\n.\nIn the last test case, Iris finally observes all the stars and the final lucky value is\n1+2+⋯+8765432=38416403456028\n.",

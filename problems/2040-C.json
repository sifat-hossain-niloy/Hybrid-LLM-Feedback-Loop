    "statement": "Consider a permutation^{\\text{∗}} p_1, p_2, ..., p_n of integers from 1 to n. We can introduce the following sum for it^{\\text{†}}:S(p) = ∑_{1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n} \\min(p_l, p_{l + 1}, ..., p_r)Let us consider all permutations of length n with the maximum possible value of S(p). Output the k-th of them in lexicographical^{\\text{‡}}order, or report that there are less than k of them.^{\\text{∗}}A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array). ^{\\text{†}}For example: For the permutation [1, 2, 3] the value of S(p) is equal to \\min(1) + \\min(1, 2) + \\min(1, 2, 3) + \\min(2) + \\min(2, 3) + \\min(3) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 = 10 For the permutation [2, 4, 1, 3] the value of S(p) is equal to \\min(2) + \\min(2, 4) + \\min(2, 4, 1) + \\min(2, 4, 1, 3) \\ + \\min(4) + \\min(4, 1) + \\min(4, 1, 3) \\ + \\min(1) + \\min(1, 3) \\ + \\min(3) = 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 17. ^{\\text{‡}}An array a is lexicographically smaller than an array b if and only if one of the following holds: a is a prefix of b, but a ≠ b; or in the first position where a and b differ, the array a has a smaller element than the corresponding element in b.",
    "input_specification": "InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). The description of the test cases follows.The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^{12}) — the length of the permutation and the index number of the desired permutation.It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10 ^ 5.",

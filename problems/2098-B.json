    "statement": "Sasha wants to buy an apartment on a street where the houses are numbered from 1 to 10^9 from left to right.There are n bars on this street, located in houses with numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. Note that there might be multiple bars in the same house, and in this case, these bars are considered distinct.Sasha is afraid that by the time he buys the apartment, some bars may close, but no more than k bars can close.For any house with number x, define f(x) as the sum of |x - y| over all open bars y (that is, after closing some bars).Sasha can potentially buy an apartment in a house with number x (where 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9) if and only if it is possible to close at most k bars so that after that f(x) becomes minimal among all houses.Determine how many different houses Sasha can potentially buy an apartment in.",
    "input_specification": "InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 ≤q n ≤q 10^5, 0 ≤q k < n) — the number of bars and the maximum number of bars that can close.The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤q a_i ≤q 10^9) — the house numbers where the bars are located.It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.",
    "output_specification": "OutputFor each test case, output a single integer — the number of houses where Sasha can buy an apartment.",

    "note": "In the first test case, none of the bars can close, so only houses numbered\n2\nand\n3\nare suitable. For the house numbered\n2\n, the sum of distances is\n|2−1|+|2−2|+|2−3|+|2−4|=4\n, and for the house numbered\n3\n, the sum of distances is\n|3−1|+|3−2|+|3−3|+|3−4|=4\n. However, for the house numbered\n1\n, the sum of distances will be\n|1−1|+|1−2|+|1−3|+|1−4|=6\n, so the house numbered\n1\nis not suitable. It can also be proven that Sasha cannot buy apartments in other houses.\nIn the second test case, the suitable houses are numbered\n6\nand\n7\n. For Sasha to choose the house numbered\n6\n, it is sufficient that none of the bars close. For Sasha to choose the house numbered\n7\n, the bars in houses\n1\nand\n6\ncan close. Then the bars will be located in houses numbered\n6\n,\n7\n, and\n7\n.",

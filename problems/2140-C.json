    "statement": "Let's define a function f(a) for an array a of length n as f(a) = \\textrm{cost} + (a_1 - a_2 + a_3 - a_4 ·s a_n) where \\textrm{cost} is zero initially.Now consider the scenario where Alice and Bob are given an array a of length n. They play a game taking at most 10^{100} turns alternately with Alice going first.In each turn, they must perform any one (only one) of the following operations: End the game for both Alice and Bob. Choose two indices l,r with 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n and swap a_l and a_r; this adds (r - l) to the \\textrm{cost}. Assume that Alice tries to maximize f(a) and Bob tries to minimize it. Your task is to determine the final value of f(a) assuming both players play optimally.",
    "input_specification": "InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) — the length of the array a.The second line contains n integers a_1,a_2,a_3,...,a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) — the elements of the array a.It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.",

    "statement": "You are given two integer arrays a and b both of length n.You can choose any subset of indices and swap the elements at those positions (i. e. make a swap(a_i, b_i) for each i in the subset). A subset of indices is considered good if, after the swapping, both arrays are sorted in non-descending order.Your task is to calculate the number of good subsets. Since the answer can be large, print it modulo 998244353.",
    "input_specification": "InputThe first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100).The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000).The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_n (1 ≤ b_i ≤ 1000).Additional constraint on the input: there is at least one good subset.",

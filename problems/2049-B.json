    "statement": "Cats are attracted to pspspsps, but Evirir, being a dignified dragon, is only attracted to pspspsps with oddly specific requirements...Given a string s = s_1s_2... s_n of length n consisting of characters p, s, and . (dot), determine whether a permutation^{\\text{∗}} p of length n exists, such that for all integers i (1 ≤ i ≤ n): If s_i is p, then [p_1, p_2, ..., p_i] forms a permutation (of length i); If s_i is s, then [p_i, p_{i+1}, ..., p_{n}] forms a permutation (of length n-i+1); If s_i is ., then there is no additional restriction. ^{\\text{∗}}A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).",
    "input_specification": "InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 500), the length of s.The second line of each test case contains a string s of length n that consists of the characters p, s, and ..It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5000.",
    "output_specification": "OutputFor each test case, output YES or NO on a line. Output YES if there is such a permutation and NO otherwise.You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings \"yEs\", \"yes\", \"Yes\", and \"YES\" will be recognized as positive responses.",

    "statement": "A circular array b of length m is nice if every element has at least one adjacent element^{\\text{∗}} that is equal to it. Formally, for every 1≤ i≤ m, at least one of the following holds: b_i = b_{(i+m-2)\\bmod m\\;+1}, or b_i = b_{i\\bmod m\\;+1}, where x \\bmod y denotes the remainder from dividing x by y. You are given a circular array a of length n. In one operation, you may increase or decrease any element of a by 1. Your task is to determine the minimum number of operations required to make array a nice. More formally, find the minimum value of ∑_{i=1}^n |b_i - a_i| among all nice circular arrays b of length n.^{\\text{∗}}In a circular array of length m: For each index 2≤ i≤ m - 1, the element at index i is adjacent to the elements at indices i - 1 and i + 1. The element at index 1 is adjacent to the elements at indices 2 and m. The element at index m is adjacent to the elements at indices m - 1 and 1.",
    "input_specification": "InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3≤ n≤ 2· 10^5) — the length of the circular array a.The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1≤ a_i≤ 10^9) — the elements of the circular array a.It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2· 10^5.",

Therefore, the circular array\n𝑎\nis already nice and no operations are required.\nIn the second test case, we can perform the following sequence of operations:\nAfter these operations, every element has at least one adjacent element with the same value:\nIn the third test case, the circular array\n𝑎\ncan become nice by decreasing\n𝑎\n4\nfour times. This results in\n𝑎=[2,2,5,5,5]\nwhich is nice as every element has at least one adjacent element with the same value.",

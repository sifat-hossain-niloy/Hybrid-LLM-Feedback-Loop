    "statement": "Skibidus was abducted by aliens of Amog! Skibidus tries to talk his way out, but the Amog aliens don't believe him. To prove that he is not totally capping, the Amog aliens asked him to solve this task:\nAn integer\n𝑥\nis considered a semi-prime if it can be written as\n𝑝⋅𝑞\nwhere\n𝑝\nand\n𝑞\nare (not necessarily distinct) prime numbers. For example,\n9\nis a semi-prime since it can be written as\n3⋅3\n, and\n3\nis a prime number.\nSkibidus was given an array\n𝑎\ncontaining\n𝑛\nintegers. He must report the number of pairs\n(𝑖,𝑗)\nsuch that\n𝑖≤𝑗\nand\nlcm(\n𝑎\n𝑖\n,\n𝑎\n𝑗\n)\n∗\nis semi-prime.\n∗\nGiven two integers\n𝑥\nand\n𝑦\n,\nlcm(𝑥,𝑦)\ndenotes the least common multiple of\n𝑥\nand\n𝑦\n.",

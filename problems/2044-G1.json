    "statement": "This is the easy version of the problem. The key difference between the two versions is highlighted in bold.A group of n spiders has come together to exchange plushies. Initially, each spider has 1 plushie. Every year, if spider i has at least one plushie, he will give exactly one plushie to spider r_i. Otherwise, he will do nothing. Note that all plushie transfers happen at the same time. In this version, if any spider has more than 1 plushie at any point in time, they will throw all but 1 away.The process is stable in the current year if each spider has the same number of plushies (before the current year's exchange) as he did the previous year (before the previous year's exchange). Note that year 1 can never be stable.Find the first year in which the process becomes stable.",
    "input_specification": "InputThe first line contains an integer t (1 ≤q t ≤q 10^4) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains an integer n (2 ≤q n ≤q 2 · 10^5) — the number of spiders.The following line contains n integers r_1, r_2, ..., r_n (1 ≤q r_i ≤q n, r_i ≠q i) — the recipient of the plushie of each spider.It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.",

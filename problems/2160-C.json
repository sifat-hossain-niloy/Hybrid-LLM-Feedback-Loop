    "statement": "Given a positive integer x, let f(x) be the positive integer formed by reversing the binary representation of x without leading zeroes. For example, if x=12=1100_2, then f(x)=0011_2=3. You are given an integer n. Please determine if there exists a positive integer x such that x \\oplus f(x) = n^{\\text{∗}}.^{\\text{∗}}Here, \\oplus denotes the bitwise XOR operation.",
    "input_specification": "InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains an integer n (0 ≤q n <2^{30}).",
    "output_specification": "OutputFor each test case, output YES if there exists a positive integer x such that x \\oplus f(x) = n, and NO otherwise.You can output the answer in any case. For example, the strings \"yEs\", \"yes\", and \"Yes\" are also recognized as positive responses.",

    "statement": "You are given two integer arrays a and b, each of length n.You may perform the following operation any number of times: Choose an index i (1 ≤ i ≤ n - 1), and set a_i := b_{i + 1}, or set b_i := a_{i + 1}. Before performing any operations, you are allowed to choose an index i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) and remove both a_i and b_i from the arrays. This removal can be done at most once.Let the number of matches between two arrays c and d of length m be the number of positions j (1 ≤ j ≤ m) such that c_j = d_j.Your task is to compute the maximum number of matches you can achieve.",

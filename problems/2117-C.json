    "statement": "Yousef has an array a of size n. He wants to partition the array into one or more contiguous segments such that each element a_i belongs to exactly one segment.A partition is called cool if, for every segment b_j, all elements in b_j also appear in b_{j + 1} (if it exists). That is, every element in a segment must also be present in the segment following it.For example, if a = [1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 5], a cool partition Yousef can make is b_1 = [1, 2], b_2 = [2, 3, 1, 5]. This is a cool partition because every element in b_1 (which are 1 and 2) also appears in b_2. In contrast, b_1 = [1, 2, 2], b_2 = [3, 1, 5] is not a cool partition, since 2 appears in b_1 but not in b_2.Note that after partitioning the array, you do not change the order of the segments. Also, note that if an element appears several times in some segment b_j, it only needs to appear at least once in b_{j + 1}.Your task is to help Yousef by finding the maximum number of segments that make a cool partition.",
    "input_specification": "InputThe first line of the input contains integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) — the size of the array.The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) — the elements of the array.It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 · 10^5.",

The maximum number of segments is\n3\n.\nIn the third test case, the only partition we can make is\n𝑏\n1\n=[5,4,3,2,1]\n. Any other partition will not satisfy the condition.

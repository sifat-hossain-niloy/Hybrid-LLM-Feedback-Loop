    "statement": "There is a linear strip divided into m cells, numbered from 1 to m from left to right.You are given n segments. Each segment is defined by four numbers: l, r, p and q — the segment covers cells from l to r inclusively and exists with probability \\frac{p}{q} (independently).Your task is to calculate the probability that each cell is covered by exactly one segment.",
    "input_specification": "InputThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5).Then n lines follow. The i-th of them contains four integers l_i, r_i, p_i and q_i (1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ m; 1 ≤ p_i < q_i < 998244353).",
    "output_specification": "OutputPrint a single integer — the probability that each cell is covered by exactly one segment, taken modulo 998244353.Formally, the probability can be expressed as an irreducible fraction \\frac{x}{y}. You have to print the value of x · y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353, where y^{-1} is an integer such that y · y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353 = 1.",

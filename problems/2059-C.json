    "statement": "Nikyr has started working as a queue manager at the company \"Black Contour.\" He needs to choose the order of servicing customers. There are a total of n queues, each initially containing 0 people. In each of the next n moments of time, there are two sequential events: New customers arrive in all queues. More formally, at the j-th moment of time, the number of people in the i-th queue increases by a positive integer a_{i,j}. Nikyr chooses exactly one of the n queues to be served at that moment in time. The number of customers in this queue becomes 0.Let the number of people in the i-th queue after all events be x_i. Nikyr wants MEX^{\\dagger} of the collection x_1, x_2, ..., x_n to be as large as possible. Help him determine the maximum value he can achieve with an optimal order of servicing the queues.^{\\dagger}The minimum excluded (MEX) of a collection of integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_k is defined as the smallest non-negative integer y which does not occur in the collection c. For example: \\operatorname{MEX}([2,2,1])= 0, since 0 does not belong to the array. \\operatorname{MEX}([3,1,0,1]) = 2, since 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. \\operatorname{MEX}([0,3,1,2]) = 4, since 0, 1, 2, and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not.",
    "input_specification": "InputEach test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of queues and moments of time.The i-th of the next n lines contains n integers a_{i,1}, a_{i,2}, ..., a_{i,n} (1 ≤ a_{i,j} ≤ 10^9) — the number of new customers in the i-th queue at each moment of time.It is guaranteed that the sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.",

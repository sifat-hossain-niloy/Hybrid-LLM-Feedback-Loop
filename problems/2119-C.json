    "statement": "Juggernaut. - Lost Dream feat.星名はる You are given four positive integers n, l, r, k. You need to find the lexicographically smallest^{\\text{∗}} array a of length n, consisting of integers, such that: For every 1 ≤q i ≤q n, l ≤q a_i ≤q r. a_1 \\, \\& \\, a_2 \\, \\& \\, ... \\, \\& \\, a_n = a_1 \\oplus a_2 \\oplus ... \\oplus a_n, where \\& denotes the bitwise AND operation and \\oplus denotes the bitwise XOR operation. If no such array exists, output -1. Otherwise, since the entire array might be too large to output, output a_k only.^{\\text{∗}}An array a is lexicographically smaller than an array b if and only if one of the following holds: a is a prefix of b, but a ≠ b; or in the first position where a and b differ, the array a has a smaller element than the corresponding element in b.",

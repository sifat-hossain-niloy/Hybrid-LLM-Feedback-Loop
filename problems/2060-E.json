    "statement": "You are given two simple undirected graphs F and G with n vertices. F has m_1 edges while G has m_2 edges. You may perform one of the following two types of operations any number of times: Select two integers u and v (1 ≤q u,v ≤q n) such that there is an edge between u and v in F. Then, remove that edge from F. Select two integers u and v (1 ≤q u,v ≤q n) such that there is no edge between u and v in F. Then, add an edge between u and v in F. Determine the minimum number of operations required such that for all integers u and v (1 ≤q u,v ≤q n), there is a path from u to v in F if and only if there is a path from u to v in G.",
    "input_specification": "InputThe first line contains an integer t (1 ≤q t ≤q 10^4) — the number of independent test cases.The first line of each test case contains three integers n, m_1, and m_2 (1 ≤q n ≤q 2· 10^5, 0 ≤q m_1,m_2 ≤q 2· 10^5) — the number of vertices, the number of edges in F, and the number of edges in G.The following m_1 lines each contain two integers u and v (1 ≤q u, v≤q n) — there is an edge between u and v in F. It is guaranteed that there are no repeated edges or self loops.The following m_2 lines each contain two integers u and v (1 ≤q u,v≤q n) — there is an edge between u and v in G. It is guaranteed that there are no repeated edges or self loops.It is guaranteed that the sum of n, the sum of m_1, and the sum of m_2 over all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^5.",

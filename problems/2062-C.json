    "statement": "Cirno has a sequence a of length n. She can perform either of the following two operations for any (possibly, zero) times unless the current length of a is 1: Reverse the sequence. Formally, [a_1,a_2,...,a_n] becomes [a_n,a_{n-1},...,a_1] after the operation. Replace the sequence with its difference sequence. Formally, [a_1,a_2,...,a_n] becomes [a_2-a_1,a_3-a_2,...,a_n-a_{n-1}] after the operation. Find the maximum possible sum of elements of a after all operations.",

    "note": "In the first test case, Cirno can not perform any operation, so the answer is\n−1000\n.\nIn the second test case, Cirno firstly reverses the sequence, then replaces the sequence with its difference sequence:\n[5,−3]→[−3,5]→[8]\n. It can be proven that this maximizes the sum, so the answer is\n8\n.\nIn the third test case, Cirno can choose not to operate, so the answer is\n1001\n.",

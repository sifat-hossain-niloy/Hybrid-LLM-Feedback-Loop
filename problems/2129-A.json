    "statement": "For a set of pairs S = \\{(a_1, b_1), (a_2, b_2), ..., (a_m, b_m)\\}, where a_i < b_i for all 1 ≤ i ≤ m, we define f(S) and g(S) as follows: Treating each (a_i, b_i) as a segment on the number line, f(S) is the length of their union. Formally, f(S) is the number of integers x such that there exists an i (1 ≤q i ≤q m) where [x, x+1] ⊂eq [a_i, b_i]. Treating each (a_i, b_i) as an undirected edge in a graph, g(S) is the number of nodes that lie on at least one simple cycle with at least 3 edges. Formally, g(S) is the number of nodes x_1 such that there exists a path x_1 → x_2 → ... → x_k → x_1 in the graph, where k ≥q 3 and all x_1, x_2, ..., x_k are distinct. For example, S = \\{(1,2), (2,4), (1,4), (4,5),(6,7)\\}, we can get f(S) = 5 and g(S) = 3.You are given n distinct pairs. Your task is to select a subset S' of these pairs such that f(S') - g(S') is maximized. You need to output the indices of the selected pairs.",
    "input_specification": "InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^3).Next n lines each contain two integers a_i and b_i (1 ≤ a_i < b_i ≤ 2n), representing a pair.It is guaranteed that all pairs are distinct within the same test case.It is guaranteed that the sum of n^2 over all test cases will not exceed 9 · 10^6.",

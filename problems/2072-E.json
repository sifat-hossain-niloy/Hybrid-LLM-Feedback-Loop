    "statement": "Akito decided to study a new powerful spell. Since it possesses immeasurable strength, it certainly requires a lot of space and careful preparation. For this, Akito went out into the field. Let's represent the field as a Cartesian coordinate system.\nFor the spell, Akito needs to place\n0≤n≤500\nstaffs at distinct integer coordinates in the field such that there will be exactly\nk\npairs\n(i,j)\nsuch that\n1≤i<j≤n\nand\nρ(i,j)=d(i,j)\n.\nHere, for two points with integer coordinates\na=(xa,ya)\nand\nb=(xb,yb)\n,\nρ(a,b)=\n√\n(xa−xb)2+(ya−yb)2\nand\nd(a,b)=|xa−xb|+|ya−yb|\n.",
    "input_specification": "The first line of input contains a single number\nt\n(\n1≤t≤1000\n) — the number of test cases.\nIn the only line of each test case, there is a single number\nk\n(\n0≤k≤105\n) — the number of pairs of staffs for which the equality\nρ(i,j)=d(i,j)\nmust hold.",
    "output_specification": "For each test case, the first line of output should print the number\nn\n(\n0≤n≤500\n) — the number of placed staffs.\nIn the following\nn\nlines, pairs of integers\nxi,yi\n(−109≤xi,yi≤109)\nshould be printed — the coordinates of the\ni\n-th staff. The points in which staffs stand must be distinct.",

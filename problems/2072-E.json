    "statement": "Akito decided to study a new powerful spell. Since it possesses immeasurable strength, it certainly requires a lot of space and careful preparation. For this, Akito went out into the field. Let's represent the field as a Cartesian coordinate system.For the spell, Akito needs to place 0 ≤ n ≤ 500 staffs at distinct integer coordinates in the field such that there will be exactly k pairs (i, j) such that 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n and \\rho(i, j) = d(i, j).Here, for two points with integer coordinates a = (x_a, y_a) and b = (x_b, y_b), \\rho(a, b) = \\sqrt{(x_a - x_b)^2 + (y_a - y_b)^2} and d(a, b) = |x_a - x_b| + |y_a - y_b|.",
    "input_specification": "InputThe first line of input contains a single number t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) — the number of test cases.In the only line of each test case, there is a single number k (0 ≤ k ≤ 10^5) — the number of pairs of staffs for which the equality \\rho(i, j) = d(i, j) must hold.",
    "output_specification": "OutputFor each test case, the first line of output should print the number n (0 ≤ n ≤ 500) — the number of placed staffs.In the following n lines, pairs of integers x_i, y_i (-10^9 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 10^9) should be printed — the coordinates of the i-th staff. The points in which staffs stand must be distinct.",

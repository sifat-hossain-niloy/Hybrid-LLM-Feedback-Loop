Any three pupils will show a worthy result in any team olympiad. But winning the olympiad is only half the battle; first, you need to get there...\nEach pupil has an independence level, expressed as an integer. In \"T-generation\", there is exactly one student with each independence levels from\n𝑙\nto\n𝑟\n, inclusive. For a team of three pupils with independence levels\n𝑎\n,\n𝑏\n, and\n𝑐\n, the value of their team independence is equal to\n(𝑎⊕𝑏)+(𝑏⊕𝑐)+(𝑎⊕𝑐)\n, where\n⊕\ndenotes the bitwise XOR operation.\nYour task is to choose any trio of students with the maximum possible team independence.",

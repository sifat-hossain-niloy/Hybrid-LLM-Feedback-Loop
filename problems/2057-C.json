    "statement": "In the upcoming year, there will be many team olympiads, so the teachers of \"T-generation\" need to assemble a team of three pupils to participate in them. Any three pupils will show a worthy result in any team olympiad. But winning the olympiad is only half the battle; first, you need to get there...Each pupil has an independence level, expressed as an integer. In \"T-generation\", there is exactly one student with each independence levels from l to r, inclusive. For a team of three pupils with independence levels a, b, and c, the value of their team independence is equal to (a \\oplus b) + (b \\oplus c) + (a \\oplus c), where \\oplus denotes the bitwise XOR operation. Your task is to choose any trio of students with the maximum possible team independence.",
    "input_specification": "InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case set contains two integers l and r (0 ≤ l, r < 2^{30}, r - l > 1) — the minimum and maximum independence levels of the students.",
    "output_specification": "OutputFor each test case set, output three pairwise distinct integers a, b, and c, such that l ≤ a, b, c ≤ r and the value of the expression (a \\oplus b) + (b \\oplus c) + (a \\oplus c) is maximized. If there are multiple triples with the maximum value, any of them can be output.",

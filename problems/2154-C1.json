    "statement": "This is the easy version of the problem. The difference between the versions is that in this version, b_i = 1 for all i (1 ≤ i ≤ n). You can hack only if you solved all versions of this problem. You find yourself with two arrays of positive integers a and b, both of length n. You will perform the following operation any number of times (possibly none): select an integer i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) and increase a_i by 1. This has a cost of b_i. Determine the minimum total cost to make it so that there exists two integers i, j where 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n and \\gcd(a_i, a_j)^{\\text{∗}} > 1.^{\\text{∗}}\\gcd(x, y) denotes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of integers x and y.",
    "input_specification": "InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) — the length of the array a.The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,...,a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 2 · 10^5).The third line of each test case contains n integers b_1,b_2,...,b_n (\\color{red}{b_i = 1}).The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.",

    "statement": "You are given an array a of size n, and an integer k. You may perform the following operation any number of times: Select two integers l and r (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ |a|) such that r-l+1 ≥q k. Then, select an index i such that l≤q i ≤q r where a_i is the k-th smallest number out of the subarray [a_l,a_{l+1},...,a_r]. If there are multiple possible i, you may select any. For example, consider a = [1, 2, 2, 1, 3], l = 1, r = 5 and k = 3, the possible candidates of i are indices 2 and 3. Then, delete a_i from a, concatenating the remaining parts of the array. Determine if it is possible to get an array that is a palindrome^{\\text{∗}} after any number of operations. Note that an empty array is considered a palindrome. ^{\\text{∗}}An array b=[b_1,b_2,...,b_m] is a palindrome if for each 1 ≤q i ≤q m, b_i=b_{m+1-i}.",
    "input_specification": "InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). The description of the test cases follows. The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤q k ≤q n ≤q 2· 10^5).The second line contains n integers a_1,a_2,...,a_n (1 ≤q a_i ≤q n) — denoting the array a.It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2· 10^5.",
    "output_specification": "OutputFor each test case, output YES if it is possible to create a palindrome, and NO otherwise. You can output in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings \"yEs\", \"yes\", \"Yes\", and \"YES\" will be recognized as positive responses.",

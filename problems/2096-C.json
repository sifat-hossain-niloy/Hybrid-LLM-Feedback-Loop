    "statement": "You are the proud leader of a city in Ancient Berland. There are n^2 buildings arranged in a grid of n rows and n columns. The height of the building in row i and column j is h_{i, j}.The city is beautiful if no two adjacent by side buildings have the same height. In other words, it must satisfy the following: There does not exist a position (i, j) (1 ≤q i ≤q n, 1 ≤q j ≤q n - 1) such that h_{i, j} = h_{i, j + 1}. There does not exist a position (i, j) (1 ≤q i ≤q n - 1, 1 ≤q j ≤q n) such that h_{i, j} = h_{i + 1, j}. There are n workers at company A, and n workers at company B. Each worker can be hired at most once.It costs a_i coins to hire worker i at company A. After hiring, worker i will: Increase the heights of all buildings in row i by 1. In other words, increase h_{i, 1}, h_{i, 2}, ..., h_{i, n} by 1. It costs b_j coins to hire worker j at company B. After hiring, worker j will: Increase the heights of all buildings in column j by 1. In other words, increase h_{1, j}, h_{2, j}, ..., h_{n, j} by 1. Find the minimum number of coins needed to make the city beautiful, or report that it is impossible.",
    "input_specification": "InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the size of the grid.The i-th of the next n lines of each test case contains n integers h_{i, 1}, h_{i, 2}, ..., h_{i, n} (1 ≤ h_{i, j} ≤ 10^9) — the heights of the buildings in row i.The next line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) — the costs of hiring the workers at company A.The next line of each test case contains n integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_n (1 ≤ b_j ≤ 10^9) — the costs of hiring the workers at company B.It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 1000.",

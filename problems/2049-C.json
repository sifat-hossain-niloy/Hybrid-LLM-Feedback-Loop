    "statement": "Evirir the dragon has many friends. They have 3 friends! That is one more than the average dragon.You are given integers n, x, and y. There are n dragons sitting in a circle. The dragons are numbered 1, 2, ..., n. For each i (1 ≤ i ≤ n), dragon i is friends with dragon i - 1 and i + 1, where dragon 0 is defined to be dragon n and dragon n + 1 is defined to be dragon 1. Additionally, dragons x and y are friends with each other (if they are already friends, this changes nothing). Note that all friendships are mutual.Output n non-negative integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that for each dragon i (1 ≤ i ≤ n), the following holds: Let f_1, f_2, ..., f_k be the friends of dragon i. Then a_i = \\operatorname{mex}(a_{f_1}, a_{f_2}, ..., a_{f_k}).^{\\text{∗}} ^{\\text{∗}}The minimum excluded (MEX) of a collection of integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_m is defined as the smallest non-negative integer t which does not occur in the collection c.",

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n, x, y (3 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ x < y ≤ n).It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.",

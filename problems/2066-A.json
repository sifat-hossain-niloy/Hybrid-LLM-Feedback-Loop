    "statement": "This is an interactive problem. You are given an array x_1, ..., x_n of integers from 1 to n. The jury also has a fixed but hidden array y_1, ..., y_n of integers from 1 to n. The elements of array y are unknown to you. Additionally, it is known that for all i, x_i ≠q y_i, and all pairs (x_i, y_i) are distinct.The jury has secretly thought of one of two objects, and you need to determine which one it is: Object A: A directed graph with n vertices numbered from 1 to n, and with n edges of the form x_i → y_i. Object B: n points on a coordinate plane. The i-th point has coordinates (x_i, y_i). To guess which object the jury has thought of, you can make queries. In one query, you must specify two numbers i, j (1 ≤q i, j ≤q n, i ≠q j). In response, you receive one number: If the jury has thought of Object A, you receive the length of the shortest path (in edges) from vertex i to vertex j in the graph, or 0 if there is no path. If the jury has thought of Object B, you receive the Manhattan distance between points i and j, that is |x_i -x_j| + |y_i - y_j|.You have 2 queries to determine which of the objects the jury has thought of.",

    "statement": "This is an interactive problem.\nYou are given an array\n𝑥\n1\n,…,\n𝑥\n𝑛\nof integers from\n1\nto\n𝑛\n. The jury also has a fixed but hidden array\n𝑦\n1\n,…,\n𝑦\n𝑛\nof integers from\n1\nto\n𝑛\n. The elements of array\n𝑦\nare unknown to you. Additionally, it is known that for all\n𝑖\n,\n𝑥\n𝑖\n≠\n𝑦\n𝑖\n, and all pairs\n(\n𝑥\n𝑖\n,\n𝑦\n𝑖\n)\nare distinct.\nThe jury has secretly thought of one of two objects, and you need to determine which one it is:\nObject A: A directed graph with\n𝑛\nvertices numbered from\n1\nto\n𝑛\n, and with\n𝑛\nedges of the form\n𝑥\n𝑖\n→\n𝑦\n𝑖\n.\nObject B:\n𝑛\npoints on a coordinate plane. The\n𝑖\n-th point has coordinates\n(\n𝑥\n𝑖\n,\n𝑦\n𝑖\n)\n.\nTo guess which object the jury has thought of, you can make queries. In one query, you must specify two numbers\n𝑖,𝑗\n(1≤𝑖,𝑗≤𝑛,𝑖≠𝑗)\n. In response, you receive one number:\nIf the jury has thought of Object A, you receive the length of the shortest path (in edges) from vertex\n𝑖\nto vertex\n𝑗\nin the graph, or\n0\nif there is no path.\nIf the jury has thought of Object B, you receive the Manhattan distance between points\n𝑖\nand\n𝑗\n, that is\n|\n𝑥\n𝑖\n−\n𝑥\n𝑗\n|+|\n𝑦\n𝑖\n−\n𝑦\n𝑗\n|\n.\nYou have\n2\nqueries to determine which of the objects the jury has thought of.",

    "output_specification": "The interaction begins with reading\n𝑛\n(\n3≤𝑛≤2⋅\n10\n5\n) — the length of the arrays\n𝑥\nand\n𝑦\nat the start of each test case.\nNext, read\n𝑛\nintegers:\n𝑥\n1\n,\n𝑥\n2\n,…,\n𝑥\n𝑛\n(\n1≤\n𝑥\n𝑖\n≤𝑛\n) — the elements of array\n𝑥\n.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of\n𝑛\nacross all test cases does not exceed\n2⋅\n10\n5\n.\nThe array\n𝑦\n1\n,\n𝑦\n2\n,…,\n𝑦\n𝑛\nis fixed for each test case.

This means that your solution will reveive Wrong answer because of an invalid query or any other mistake. Failing to exit can result in an arbitrary verdict because your solution will continue to read from a closed stream.

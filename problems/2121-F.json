The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains three integers n, s, and x (1 ≤q n ≤q 2 · 10^5, -2 · 10^{14} ≤q s ≤q 2 · 10^{14}, -10^9 ≤q x ≤q 10^9). The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (-10^9 ≤q a_i ≤q 10^9).It is guaranteed that the sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.",

    "statement": "You would like to construct a string s, consisting of lowercase Latin letters, such that the following condition holds: For every pair of indices i and j such that s_{i} = s_{j}, the difference of these indices is even, that is, |i - j| \\bmod 2 = 0. Constructing any string is too easy, so you will be given an array c of 26 numbers — the required number of occurrences of each individual letter in the string s. So, for every i ∈ [1, 26], the i-th letter of the Latin alphabet should occur exactly c_i times.Your task is to count the number of distinct strings s that satisfy all these conditions. Since the answer can be huge, output it modulo 998\\,244\\,353.",
    "input_specification": "InputEach test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^{4})— the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.Each test case contains 26 integers c_{i} (0 ≤ c_{i} ≤ 5 · 10^{5})— the elements of the array c.Additional constraints on the input data: The sum of c_{i} for every test case is positive; The sum of c_{i} over all test cases does not exceed 5 · 10^{5}.",
    "output_specification": "OutputFor each test case, print one integer — the number of suitable strings s, taken modulo 998\\,244\\,353.",

    "statement": "Akito still has nowhere to live, and the price for a small room is everywhere. For this reason, Akito decided to get a job at a bank as a key creator for storages.In this magical world, everything is different. For example, the key for a storage with the code (n, x) is an array a of length n such that: a_1 \\ | \\ a_2 \\ | \\ a_3 \\ | \\ ... \\ | \\ a_n = x, where a \\ | \\ b is the bitwise \"OR\" of numbers a and b. \\text{MEX}(\\{ a_1, a_2, a_3, ..., a_n \\})^{\\text{∗}} is maximized among all such arrays. Akito diligently performed his job for several hours, but suddenly he got a headache. Substitute for him for an hour; for the given n and x, create any key for the storage with the code (n, x).^{\\text{∗}}\\text{MEX}(S) is the minimum non-negative integer z such that z is not contained in the set S and all 0 ≤ y < z are contained in S.",

    "output_specification": "OutputFor each test case, output n integers a_i (0 ≤ a_i < 2^{30}) — the elements of the key array that satisfy all the conditions.If there are multiple suitable arrays, output any of them.",

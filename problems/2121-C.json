    "statement": "You are given a matrix of integers with n rows and m columns. The cell at the intersection of the i-th row and the j-th column contains the number a_{ij}.You can perform the following operation exactly once: Choose two numbers 1 ≤q r ≤q n and 1 ≤q c ≤q m. For all cells (i, j) in the matrix such that i = r or j = c, decrease a_{ij} by one.You need to find the minimal possible maximum value in the matrix a after performing exactly one such operation.",
    "input_specification": "InputEach test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤q t ≤q 10^4) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 ≤q n · m ≤q 10^5) — the number of rows and columns in the matrix.The next n lines of each test case describe the matrix a. The i-th line contains m integers a_{i1}, a_{i2}, ..., a_{im} (1 ≤q a_{ij} ≤q 100) — the elements in the i-th row of the matrix.It is guaranteed that the sum of n · m across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.",

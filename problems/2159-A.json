    "statement": "This is an interactive problem. There is a secret sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n-1},a_{2n}, which contains each integer from 1 to n exactly twice.Your task is to guess the sequence by using queries of the following type: \"? k\\;j_1\\;j_2\\;...\\;j_k\" — select the integer k (1 ≤ k ≤ 2n) and k distinct indices j_1, j_2, ..., j_k (1 ≤ j_1 , j_2 , ... , j_k ≤ 2n). In response to the query, the jury will return \\text{MAD}([a_{j_1}, a_{j_2}, ..., a_{j_k}]). We define the \\operatorname{MAD} (Maximum Appearing Duplicate) of an integer sequence as the largest integer that appears at least twice. Specifically, if there is no number that appears at least twice, the \\operatorname{MAD} value is 0. Some examples are as follows: \\operatorname{MAD}([1, 2, 1]) = 1; \\operatorname{MAD}([2, 2, 3, 3]) = 3; \\operatorname{MAD}([1, 2, 3, 4]) = 0. Please identify the secret sequence using at most 3n queries.",

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 300).It is guaranteed that the sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.After you read this line of input, the interaction begins with your first query.",

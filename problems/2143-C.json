    "statement": "You are given a tree consisting of n vertices, numbered from 1 to n. Each of the n - 1 edges is associated with two non-negative integers x and y.Consider a permutation^{\\text{∗}} p of the integers 1 through n, where p_i represents the value assigned to vertex i.For an edge (u, v), such that u < v with associated values x and y, its contribution is defined as follows: \\begin{cases} x & \\text{if } p_u > p_v, \\\\ y & \\text{otherwise.} \\end{cases} The value of the permutation is the sum of the contributions from all edges.Your task is to find any permutation p that maximizes this total value.^{\\text{∗}}A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).",
    "input_specification": "InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). The description of the test cases follows. The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) — the number of vertices in the tree.Each of the next n - 1 lines contains four integers u, v, x, and y (1 ≤ u < v ≤ n, 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9) — describing an edge between vertices u and v with associated values x and y. It is guarranteed that the given edges form a tree.It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.",
    "output_specification": "OutputFor each test case, you must output a permutation p of the integers 1 through n that maximizes the total value as defined in the problem. If there are multiple answers, you can print any of them.",

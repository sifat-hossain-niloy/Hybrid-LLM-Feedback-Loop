    "statement": "ParagonX9 - HyperioxX⠀Alice has a grid of size n × n. Initially, all cells are colored white. Alice wants to color some cells black satisfying certain properties.Let (x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), ..., (x_m, y_m) be the cells colored black. You are given an array a of size n. The following conditions must be satisfied: For each row k (1 ≤ k ≤ n), there exists exactly a_k indices i (1 ≤ i ≤ m) such that x_i = k. Less formally, there should be a_k black cells in row k. For each k (1 ≤ k ≤ n), there exists exactly one index i such that \\max(x_i, y_i) = k. For each k (1 ≤ k ≤ n), there exists exactly one index i such that \\max(x_i, n + 1 - y_i) = k. For example, when a = [2, 2, 1, 0, 0], a possible set of black cells is \\{(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (2, 4), (1, 5)\\}. This corresponds to the following grid: 5×5 grid with specified black cells. Count the number of possible grids. 2 grids are said to be different if there is some cell which is colored black in one of the grids, and white in the other. Since the answer may be large, output it modulo 998\\,244\\,353.",

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5).The second line of each test case contains n integers — a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n)It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.",

    "statement": "Vadim wanted to understand the infinite sequence of digits that consists of the positive integers written consecutively from 1 to infinity. That is, this sequence looks like 123456789101112131415 ...To avoid looking into infinity, Vadim cut this sequence at the k-th digit and discarded everything after it. Thus, exactly k digits remained in the sequence. Help him find the sum of the digits in the remaining sequence.",
    "input_specification": "InputEach test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4) — the number of test cases. The following lines describe the test cases.In a single line of each test case, there is an integer k — the number of digits in the remaining sequence (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^{15}).",

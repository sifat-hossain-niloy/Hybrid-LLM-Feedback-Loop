For example, [4,2,3,4] is a permutation of [3,2,4,4] while [1,2,2] is not a permutation of [1,2,3].",
    "input_specification": "InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 ≤q n ≤q 10^5).The second line of each test case contains n integers p_0, p_1, ...,p_{n-1} (0 ≤q p_i < n).The third line of each test case contains n integers q_0, q_1, ...,q_{n-1} (0 ≤q q_i < n).It is guaranteed that both p and q are permutations of [0, 1, ..., n-1].It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.",

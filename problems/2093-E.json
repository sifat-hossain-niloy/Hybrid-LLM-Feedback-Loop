    "statement": "You are given an array a of length n and a number k.A subarray is defined as a sequence of one or more consecutive elements of the array. You need to split the array a into k non-overlapping subarrays b_1, b_2, ..., b_k such that the union of these subarrays equals the entire array. Additionally, you need to maximize the value of x, which is equal to the minimum MEX(b_i), for i ∈ [1..k].MEX(v) denotes the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array v.",

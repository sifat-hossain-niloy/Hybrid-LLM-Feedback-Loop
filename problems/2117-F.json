    "statement": "Yousef has a rooted tree^{\\text{∗}} consisting of exactly n vertices, which is rooted at vertex 1. You would like to give Yousef an array a of length n, where each a_i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) can either be 1 or 2.Let s_u denote the sum of a_v where vertex v is in the subtree^{\\text{†}} of vertex u. Yousef considers the tree special if all the values in s are pairwise distinct (i.e., all subtree sums are unique).Your task is to help Yousef count the number of different arrays a that result in the tree being special. Two arrays b and c are different if there exists an index i such that b_i ≠q c_i.As the result can be very large, you should print it modulo 10^9 + 7.^{\\text{∗}}A tree is a connected undirected graph with n - 1 edges.^{\\text{†}}The subtree of a vertex v is the set of all vertices that pass through v on a simple path to the root. Note that vertex v is also included in the set.",
    "input_specification": "InputThe first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases.Each test case consists of several lines. The first line of the test case contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) — the number of vertices in the tree.Then n−1 lines follow, each of them contains two integers u and v (1 ≤ u,v ≤ n, u ≠ v) which describe a pair of vertices connected by an edge. It is guaranteed that the given graph is a tree and has no loops or multiple edges.It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 · 10^5.",
    "output_specification": "OutputFor each test case, print one integer x — the number of different arrays a that result in the tree being special, modulo 10^9 + 7.",

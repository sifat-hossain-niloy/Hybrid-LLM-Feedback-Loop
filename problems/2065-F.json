    "statement": "Let's define the majority of a sequence of k elements as the unique value that appears strictly more than ≤ft \\lfloor {\\frac{k}{2}} \\right \\rfloor times. If such a value does not exist, then the sequence does not have a majority. For example, the sequence [1,3,2,3,3] has a majority 3 because it appears 3 > ≤ft \\lfloor {\\frac{5}{2}} \\right \\rfloor = 2 times, but [1,2,3,4,5] and [1,3,2,3,4] do not have a majority.Skibidus found a tree^{\\text{∗}} of n vertices and an array a of length n. Vertex i has the value a_i written on it, where a_i is an integer in the range [1, n].For each i from 1 to n, please determine if there exists a non-trivial simple path^{\\text{†}} such that i is the majority of the sequence of integers written on the vertices that form the path.^{\\text{∗}}A tree is a connected graph without cycles. ^{\\text{†}}A sequence of vertices v_1, v_2, ..., v_m (m ≥q 2) forms a non-trivial simple path if v_i and v_{i+1} are connected by an edge for all 1 ≤q i ≤q m - 1 and all v_i are pairwise distinct. Note that the path must consist of at least 2 vertices.",
    "input_specification": "InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5)  — the number of vertices.The second line of each test case contains a_1,a_2,...,a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n)  — the integers written on the vertices.Each of the next n-1 lines contains two integers u_i and v_i, denoting the two vertices connected by an edge (1 ≤ u_i,v_i ≤ n, u_i ≠q v_i).It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 · 10^5.",
    "output_specification": "OutputFor each test case, output a binary string s of length n on a separate line. s_i should be computed as follows: If there is a non-trivial path containing i as the majority, s_i is '1'; Otherwise, s_i is '0'.",

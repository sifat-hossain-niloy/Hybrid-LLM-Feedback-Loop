    "statement": "You are given an array a of size n and an integer k. You do the following procedure k times: For each element a_i, you set a_i to \\operatorname{mex}^{\\text{∗}}(a_1,a_2,...,a_{i-1},a_{i+1},a_{i+2}, ...,a_n). In other words, you set a_i to the \\operatorname{mex} of all other elements in the array. This is done for all elements in the array at the same time. Please find the sum of elements in the array after all k operations. ^{\\text{∗}}The minimum excluded (MEX) of a collection of integers d_1, d_2, ..., d_k is defined as the smallest non-negative integer x which does not occur in the collection d.",
    "input_specification": "InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). The description of the test cases follows. The first line contains two integers n and k (2 ≤q n ≤q 2· 10^5, 1 ≤q k ≤q 10^9) – the number of elements in a and the number of operations done.The second line contains n integers a_1,a_2,...,a_n (0 ≤q a_i ≤q n).It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2· 10^5.",

It can be shown that the array will not change no matter how many times we perform the operation, so the final array after three operations is still\n[0,2,1]\n.

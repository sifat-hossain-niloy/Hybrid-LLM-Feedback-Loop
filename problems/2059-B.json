    "statement": "You are given an array a of length n and an even integer k (2 ≤ k ≤ n). You need to split the array a into exactly k non-empty subarrays^{\\dagger} such that each element of the array a belongs to exactly one subarray.Next, all subarrays with even indices (second, fourth, ..., k-th) are concatenated into a single array b. After that, 0 is added to the end of the array b.The cost of the array b is defined as the minimum index i such that b_i ≠q i. For example, the cost of the array b = [1, 2, 4, 5, 0] is 3, since b_1 = 1, b_2 = 2, and b_3 ≠q 3. Determine the minimum cost of the array b that can be obtained with an optimal partitioning of the array a into subarrays.^{\\dagger}An array x is a subarray of an array y if x can be obtained from y by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.",
    "input_specification": "InputEach test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, k is even) — the length of the array a and the number of subarrays.The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) — the elements of the array a.It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.",

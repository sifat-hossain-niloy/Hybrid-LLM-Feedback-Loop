    "statement": "This is the easy version of the problem. The difference between the versions is that in this version, n ≤ 300. You can hack only if you solved all versions of this problem. A sequence b_1, b_2, ..., b_k is called good if there exists a coloring of each index i in red or blue such that for every pair of indices i < j with b_i > b_j, the colors assigned to i and j are different.You are given a sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. Compute the number of good subsequences of the sequence, including the empty subsequence^{\\text{∗}}. Since the answer can be very large, output it modulo 10^9 + 7.^{\\text{∗}}A sequence b is a subsequence of a sequence a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) element from arbitrary positions.",
    "input_specification": "InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100). The description of the test cases follows. The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤q n ≤q 300) — the length of the sequenceThe second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) — the contents of the sequence.It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 300.",

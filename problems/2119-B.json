    "statement": "PIKASONIC - Lost My Mind (feat.nakotanmaru) You are given two points (p_x,p_y) and (q_x,q_y) on a Euclidean plane.You start at the starting point (p_x,p_y) and will perform n operations. In the i-th operation, you must choose any point such that the Euclidean distance^{\\text{∗}} between your current position and the point is exactly a_i, and then move to that point.Determine whether it is possible to reach the terminal point (q_x,q_y) after performing all operations.^{\\text{∗}}The Euclidean distance between (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) is \\sqrt{(x_1 - x_2)^2 + (y_1 - y_2)^2}",
    "input_specification": "InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1≤q n ≤q 10^3) — the length of the sequence a.The second line of each test case contains four integers p_x,p_y,q_x,q_y (1≤q p_x,p_y,q_x,q_y≤q 10^7) — the coordinates of the starting point and terminal point.The third line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,...,a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4) — the distance to move in each operation.It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2· 10^5.",
    "output_specification": "OutputFor each test case, output \"Yes\" if it is possible to reach the terminal point (q_x,q_y) after all operations; otherwise, output \"No\".You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings \"yEs\", \"yes\", \"Yes\", and \"YES\" will be recognized as positive responses.",

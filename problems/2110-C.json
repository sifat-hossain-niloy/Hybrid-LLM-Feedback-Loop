    "statement": "In 2077, a sport called hobby-droning is gaining popularity among robots.You already have a drone, and you want to win. For this, your drone needs to fly through a course with n obstacles.The i-th obstacle is defined by two numbers l_i, r_i. Let the height of your drone at the i-th obstacle be h_i. Then the drone passes through this obstacle if l_i ≤ h_i ≤ r_i. Initially, the drone is on the ground, meaning h_0 = 0.The flight program for the drone is represented by an array d_1, d_2, ..., d_n, where h_{i} - h_{i-1} = d_i, and 0 ≤q d_i ≤q 1. This means that your drone either does not change height between obstacles or rises by 1. You already have a flight program, but some d_i in it are unknown and marked as -1. Replace the unknown d_i with numbers 0 and 1 to create a flight program that passes through the entire obstacle course, or report that it is impossible.",
    "input_specification": "InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). The description of the test cases follows. In the first line of each test case, an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) is given — the size of the array d.In the second line of each test case, there are n integers d_1, d_2, ..., d_n (-1 ≤q d_i ≤q 1) — the elements of the array d. d_i = -1 means that this d_i is unknown to you.Next, there are n lines containing 2 integers l_i,r_i (0≤q l_i≤q r_i≤q n) — descriptions of the obstacles.It is guaranteed that the sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2· 10^5.",
    "output_specification": "OutputFor each test case, output n integers d_1,d_2,...,d_n, if it is possible to correctly restore the array d, or -1 if it is not possible.",

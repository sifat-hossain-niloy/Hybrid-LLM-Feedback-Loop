    "statement": "Neo wants to escape from the Matrix. In front of him are n buttons arranged in a row. Each button has a weight given by an integer: a_1, a_2, ..., a_n.Neo is immobilized, but he can create and move clones. This means he can perform an unlimited number of actions of the following two types in any order: Create a clone in front of a specific button. Move an existing clone one position to the left or right. As soon as a clone is in front of another button that has not yet been pressed—regardless of whether he was created or moved — he immediately presses it. If the button has already been pressed, a clone does nothing — buttons can only be pressed once.For Neo to escape, he needs to press all the buttons in such an order that the sequence of their weights is non-increasing — that is, if b_1, b_2, ..., b_n are the weights of the buttons in the order they are pressed, then it must hold that b_1 ≥q b_2 ≥q ·s ≥q b_n.Your task is to determine the minimum number of clones that Neo needs to create in order to press all the buttons in a valid order.",
    "input_specification": "InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains one integer n (1 ≤q n ≤q 2 · 10^5) — the number of buttons.The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤q a_i ≤q 10^9) — the weights of the buttons.It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.",

    "statement": "Kevin discovered a binary string s that starts with 1 in the river at Moonlit River Park and handed it over to you. Your task is to select two non-empty substrings^{\\text{∗}} of s (which can be overlapped) to maximize the XOR value of these two substrings.The XOR of two binary strings a and b is defined as the result of the \\oplus operation applied to the two numbers obtained by interpreting a and b as binary numbers, with the leftmost bit representing the highest value. Here, \\oplus denotes the bitwise XOR operation.The strings you choose may have leading zeros.^{\\text{∗}}A string a is a substring of a string b if a can be obtained from b by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the end.",
    "input_specification": "InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3).The only line of each test case contains a binary string s that starts with 1 (1≤\\lvert s\\rvert≤ 5000).It is guaranteed that the sum of \\lvert s\\rvert over all test cases doesn't exceed 5000.",
    "output_specification": "OutputFor each test case, output four integers l_1, r_1, l_2, r_2 (1 ≤ l_1 ≤ r_1 ≤ |s|, 1 ≤ l_2 ≤ r_2 ≤ |s|) — in the case the two substrings you selected are s_{l_1} s_{l_1 + 1} ... s_{r_1} and s_{l_2} s_{l_2 + 1} ... s_{r_2}.If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.",

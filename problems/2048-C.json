Your task is to select two non-empty substrings\n∗\nof\ns\n(which can be overlapped) to maximize the XOR value of these two substrings.\nThe XOR of two binary strings\na\nand\nb\nis defined as the result of the\n⊕\noperation applied to the two numbers obtained by interpreting\na\nand\nb\nas binary numbers, with the leftmost bit representing the highest value. Here,\n⊕\ndenotes the bitwise XOR operation.\nThe strings you choose may have leading zeros.\n∗\nA string\na\nis a substring of a string\nb\nif\na\ncan be obtained from\nb\nby the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the end.",

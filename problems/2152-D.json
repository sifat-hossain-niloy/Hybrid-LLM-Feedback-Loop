    "statement": "For an array b=[b_1,b_2,...,b_m] of length m (b_i ≥q 2), consider the following two-player game played by Poby and Rekkles. The players take turns, with Poby moving first. On Poby's turn, he must choose an element x ≥ 2 and replace it with ≤ft\\lfloor \\frac{x}{2} \\right\\rfloor. In other words, he picks i (1 ≤q i ≤q m) such that b_i ≥ 2, then does b_i := ≤ft\\lfloor \\frac{b_i}{2} \\right\\rfloor. On Rekkles' turn, he must choose an element x ≥ 2 from the array b and replace it with x+1. In other words, he picks i (1 ≤q i ≤q m) such that b_i ≥ 2, then does b_i := b_i+1. The game ends once all elements in the array b are equal to 1.Define the score of the game as the number of moves that Poby makes. Poby's goal is to minimize the score, while Rekkles's goal is to maximize the score.Then, the value of the array b is the score of the game when both players play optimally.You are given an integer array a of length n (a_i ≥ 2).Answer q independent queries. In each query, you are given a range 1 ≤q l ≤q r ≤q n and must find the value of the array [a_l, a_{l+1}, ..., a_r].",
    "input_specification": "InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 ≤ n, q ≤ 250\\,000) — the length of the array and the number of queries.The next line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (2 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) — the elements of the array a.Then q lines follow. The j-th of them contains two integers l_j and r_j (1 ≤ l_j ≤ r_j ≤ n) — the range of the subarray for the i-th query.It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 250\\,000. It is guaranteed that the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 250\\,000.",

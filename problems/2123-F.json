    "statement": "Call a permutation^{\\text{∗}} p of length n good if \\gcd(p_i, i)^{\\text{†}} > 1 for all 2 ≤q i ≤q n. Find a good permutation with the minimum number of fixed points^{\\text{‡}} across all good permutations of length n. If there are multiple such permutations, print any of them.^{\\text{∗}} A permutation of length n is an array that contains every integer from 1 to n exactly once, in any order. ^{\\text{†}}\\gcd(x, y) denotes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of x and y.^{\\text{‡}}A fixed point of a permutation p is an index j (1≤q j≤q n) such that p_j = j.",
    "input_specification": "InputThe first line contains an integer t (1 ≤q t ≤q 10^4)  — the number of test cases.The only line of each test case contains an integer n (2 ≤q n ≤q 10^5) — the length of the permutation.It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.",

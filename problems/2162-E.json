    "statement": "We call an array [b_1, b_2, ..., b_m] of length m palindromic if the following condition holds: b_i = b_{m-i+1} for all 1 ≤ i ≤ m In other words, an array is palindromic if it reads the same forward and backward.You are given an array [a_1, a_2, ... , a_n] of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n and an integer k.You are required to perform the following operation exactly k times: choose an integer x such that 1 ≤ x ≤ n, append x to the end of the array a. Your goal is to perform these k operations in such a way that the number of palindromic subarrays^{\\text{∗}} in the resulting array is minimized.Output the k integers you chose for each operation, in the order they were appended.^{\\text{∗}}An array b is a subarray of an array a if b can be obtained from a by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end. In particular, an array is a subarray of itself.",

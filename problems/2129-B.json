    "statement": "You are given a permutation p_1, p_2, ..., p_n of length n.You have to build an array a_1, a_2, ..., a_n in the following way: for each 1 ≤q i ≤q n, set either a_i = p_i or a_i = 2n - p_i. Find the minimum possible number of inversions in the array a_1, a_2, ..., a_n.A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array). An inversion in the array a_1, a_2, ..., a_n is a pair of indices (i, j) such that 1 ≤q i<j ≤q n and a_i>a_j.",
    "input_specification": "InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^3).The second line of each test case contains n integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_n (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n). It is guaranteed that p_1, p_2, ..., p_n is a permutation.It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 · 10^3.",

    "statement": "You are given an array a of n integers. We define the \\text{beauty} of a number x to be the number of 1 bits in its binary representation. We define the beauty of an array to be the sum of beauties of the numbers it contains. In one operation, you can select an index i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) and increase a_i by 1. Find the maximum beauty of the array after doing at most k operations.",
    "input_specification": "InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^{18}) — the length of the array and the maximal number of operations. The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ... a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) —denoting the array a.It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5000.",

    "statement": "Wolf has found n sheep with tastiness values p_1, p_2, ..., p_n where p is a permutation^{\\text{∗}}. Wolf wants to perform binary search on p to find the sheep with tastiness of k, but p may not necessarily be sorted. The success of binary search on the range [l, r] for k is represented as f(l, r, k), which is defined as follows:If l > r, then f(l, r, k) fails. Otherwise, let m = \\lfloor\\frac{l + r}{2}\\rfloor, and: If p_m = k, then f(l, r, k) is successful, If p_m < k, then f(l, r, k) = f(m+1, r, k), If p_m > k, then f(l, r, k) = f(l, m-1, k). Cow the Nerd decides to help Wolf out. Cow the Nerd is given q queries, each consisting of three integers l, r, and k. Before the search begins, Cow the Nerd may choose a non-negative integer d, and d indices 1 ≤ i_1 < i_2 < ... < i_d ≤ n where p_{i_j} ≠q k over all 1 ≤q j ≤q d. Then, he may re-order the elements p_{i_1}, p_{i_2}, ..., p_{i_d} however he likes.For each query, output the minimum integer d that Cow the Nerd must choose so that f(l, r, k) can be successful, or report that it is impossible. Note that the queries are independent and the reordering is not actually performed.^{\\text{∗}}A permutation of length n is an array that contains every integer from 1 to n exactly once.",
    "input_specification": "InputThe first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test contains two integers n and q (1 ≤ n, q ≤ 2 · 10^5) — the length of p and the number of queries respectively.The second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_n — the tastiness of the i-th sheep. It is guaranteed that every integer from 1 to n appears exactly once in p.The following q lines contain three integers l, r, and k (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n, 1 ≤ k ≤ n) — the range that the binary search will be performed on and the integer being searched for each query.It is guaranteed that the sum of n and the sum of q over all cases do not exceed 2 · 10^5.",

    "input_specification": "InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (3 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9) — the length of the array a and the constant k.The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) — the elements of the array a.It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.",

The median of the three subarray medians is\nmed(3,2,1)=2\n. Therefore, the answer for the first test case is \"YES\" since\n2≤2\n, while the answer for the second test case is \"NO\" since\n2>1\n.\nIn the third test case, it can be proven that no partition satisfies the constraints.\nIn the fourth test case, one of the partitions satisfying the constraints is\n[10,7]\n,\n[12,16,3,15]\n,\n[6,11]\n. The respective medians of subarrays are\n7\n,\n12\n, and\n6\n. The median of the three subarray medians is\nmed(7,12,6)=7≤𝑘\n, hence this partition satisfies the constraints.\nIn the fifth test case, one of the partitions satisfying the constraints is\n[7,11]\n,\n[12,4]\n,\n[9,17]\n. The respective medians of the subarrays are\n7\n,\n4\n, and\n9\n. The median of the three subarray medians is\nmed(7,4,9)=7≤𝑘\n, hence this partition satisfies the constraints.\nIn the sixth test case, the only possible partition of the array into three contiguous subarrays is\n[1000]\n,\n[\n10\n9\n]\n,\n[1000]\n.

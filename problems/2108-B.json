    "statement": "On a recent birthday, your best friend Maurice gave you a pair of numbers n and x, and asked you to construct an array of positive numbers a of length n such that a_1 \\oplus a_2 \\oplus ·s \\oplus a_n = x ^{\\text{∗}}. This task seemed too simple to you, and therefore you decided to give Maurice a return gift by constructing an array among all such arrays that has the smallest sum of its elements. You immediately thought of a suitable array; however, since writing it down turned out to be too time-consuming, Maurice will have to settle for just the sum of its elements.^{\\text{∗}}\\oplus denotes the bitwise XOR operation.",
    "input_specification": "InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). The description of the test cases follows. Each test case consists of a single line containing a pair of numbers n and x (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, \\; 0 ≤ x ≤ 10^9) — the numbers given to you by Maurice.",
    "output_specification": "OutputFor each test case, output your gift to Maurice — the sum of the elements of the array that satisfies all the described properties. If a suitable array does not exist, output -1.",
